            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Worſhipful, Grave, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctours of the Famous Univerſity of <hi>OXFORD, Health and Salvation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe worthily admires the <hi>Oxonian Academie</hi> for its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and Learning, for the great multitude of famous Doctors, which have flouriſhed in its boſome, Structures in its Colledges, rare Library, compleatly ſtored with books of all ſorts; but principally Manuſcripts, which if not diminiſhed by the deſtiny of <hi>Funus Scoti et Scotiſtarum,</hi> would have far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of Chriſtendome; and now may contend for equality, except only the <hi>Vatican:</hi> Its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent glory is in no mean way augmented, by that magnificent Theater; which the late <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to his eternal Glory has erected; wherein all may depredicate his <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,</hi> and other <hi>Univerſities</hi> envy <hi>Oxfords Glory.</hi> This indeed is <hi>Sheldons Trophy,</hi> and <hi>Triumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon reflection of this unparaleld Theater, I cannot but deplore, that ſuch an excellent, and ſo magnificent a ſtructure ſhould be abuſed, and defiled by ſuch an unſeemly Imp, as the late Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Daniel Brevent</hi> has hatched under its
<pb facs="tcp:58254:3"/>roof; I mean his <hi>Miſſale Romanum</hi> Printed in that Theatre without any licenſe or approbation, wherein there is very little appears which may beſeem a Doctour of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begins indeed very briskly, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roman Church to have been a true Church, in the firſt five hundred years after Chriſt; but afterwards to have decayed; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for that from that time, the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and approved the holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which he chiefly labours to reject, by Railleries, ſcoffs and jeerings; amongſt others he grounds himſelf on two manifeſtly falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: the firſt is, <hi>that Roman Prieſts do ſacrifice their God,</hi> imitating the primitive Infidels, who imputed it to the Chriſtians, that they did eat their God, whereas our faith teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us, that Chriſts body and bloud is ſacrificed to God: The ſecond is, <hi>that the Prieſts at the Altar, do work all the Miracles which are wrought in the Euchariſt;</hi> which Miracles by Catholicks are attributed to Chriſt himſelf who inſtituted the holy Sacrament. To make his raillery more compleat, he ſpares not to call all Roman Catholicks, Adulterers, Adorers of vile creatures, Idol-worſhipers, invaders of ſacred offices, ſacrilegiouſly reproaching them of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, impieties, fearfull and barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Prieſthood a moſt ſacrilegious function; which in plain terms he admits for almoſt twelve hundred years, the whole Chriſtian world were
<pb facs="tcp:58254:3"/>no better then Idolaters; nay, as he ſays worſe then all Pagans and Infidels.</p>
            <p>So that the whole Church, all Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings and Princes, all Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Kingdoms, Nations, and Provinces were enſlaved to Idolatry, all Popes, Primats, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy-men; were liable to his cenſures. No Church either univerſal or particular, truly Chriſtian, no Converſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nation, in particular <hi>England,</hi> to the true faith of Chriſt, for thoſe, who were converted in thoſe times, were moſt unhappy, for they were alwayes taught, believed and exerciſed the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe. All the Modern Churches, as beſides the <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Grecian, Oriental, Affrican</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> in all places of the world (except only ſome of our pretended Reformers, in a little Corner thereof,) have the ſame: and the ſchoolmen whom he ſo frequently cites, were all Idolaters, for they all held, maintained and defended the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, againſt all Infidels and hereticks, and for the moſt part were ſacrificing Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Glory of your famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, is much impeached, by this his Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; for your Doctors and Profeſſors, your Churches, Chappels, and Schools; your Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Chairs were all infected with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Idolatry; for within their walls no other doctrine was taught, heard, or uſed, until theſe laſt times, the ſeveral Comments,
<pb facs="tcp:58254:4"/>made on the Maſter of the ſentences, on S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Scotus</hi> and other Schoolmen, teſtifies the ſame; nothing can excuſe them, but groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but what ſhall we ſay of thoſe famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, who have ſo learnedly written againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> even on the ſame ſcore; and what of thoſe Reverend and learned Biſhops, who in <hi>Oxford</hi> condemned him, as an heretick, and who were ſo careful (as is manifeſt in <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciali veteri</hi> reprinted at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the year <hi>1669.</hi>) of the Celebration of Maſs. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor beſpatters them all with Idolatry, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and blindneſs, ignorance and blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>But he might have conſidered, if malice or Ignorance had not blinded him; that under the name of the Roman Church, for ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of years, he impugns Chriſts Church within the five hundred years after Chriſt; even as it was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtels; for the Catholick Church was never without Maſs, in that time; and what Maſſes or Liturgies were uſed in ſucceeding times, were delivered from thoſe times; as the Roman or Latin Church challenges that of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as it was declared by S. <hi>Clement;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſome other parts that of S. <hi>James;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Affirica,</hi> that of S. <hi>Mark</hi> or S. <hi>Philip:</hi> The Grecians that of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> who as S. <hi>Proclus</hi> teſtifies, did not add to any other precedent, but contract and abreviate what was formerly uſed. S. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> did the ſame to that of S. <hi>Baſil;</hi> yet both
<pb facs="tcp:58254:4"/>theſe liturgies or Maſſes, are in uſe to this day, in all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Churches: if then the Maſs be Idolatry, and ſo fond a thing as this Doctor pretends; Chriſt never had a true Church upon earth: far as I ſhall ſhew in this ſhort Tract, the Catholick Church was never without the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, if we may believe Tradition, practiſe, and cuſtome of all Chriſtian Churches, Eccleſiaſtical or civil hiſtories; Councils both General and of ſeveral Provinces in the whole world; and the unanimous conſent of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers and Doctors.</p>
            <p>I dare challenge Doctour <hi>Brevent,</hi> or any of his aſſociates, to produce any one Nation, that ever roceived the Chriſtian Faith without this ſacrifice, or publick Divine Service but that which we call Maſs or liturgy, under the notion of a ſacrifice: The <hi>Grecians,</hi> as I ſaid before, and all thoſe who belong to that Church, as <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Sclavonians, Ruſſians, Muſcovits,</hi> and in many parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> agree in the ſacrifice of the Maſs with ſome difference of Ceremonies. The Meridional parts, which contain the <hi>Nubians,</hi> the <hi>Abiſſins,</hi> and greateſt parts in <hi>Aegypt, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> under the Patriarkate of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> The <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> diſperſed in <hi>Tartary, Perſia,</hi> and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental parts, and kingdoms of <hi>India:</hi> the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Scithians:</hi> I do not ſay, that all theſe agree with the <hi>Latins</hi> in the manner or forme of Maſs, or in their opinions; but in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb facs="tcp:58254:5"/>of a Sacrifice according to the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical law, they all agree; deriving their form, rites, and ceremonies from the primitive times, that is, from the Patriarchal, Churches, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtles, and their immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours: <hi>In ſine,</hi> all the patriarchal Sees of <hi>Rome, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> together with that that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have uſed, maintained, and approved the ſacrifice of the Maſs. It would be little leſs then Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to make them all Miſtreſſes and fomenters of Idolatry: and conſequently, that the Church which Chriſt and his Apoſtles had erected, founded, and eſtabliſhed, was Idolatrous, and the true Chriſtian Church never appeared in any Nation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</p>
            <p>But what do I inſiſt in this manner; when I ſpeak to learned and underſtanding men, who well know the truth of what I ſay, and to whoſe judgments I humbly remit what I write; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting they will not condemn my boldneſs, but attribute it to the Zeal I have of the honour of that reverend <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, which I ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and eſteem; and for whoſe true glory and happy progreſs, I offer up my continual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, remaining alwaies</p>

               <p>THe ancient and moſt learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the ſacred text, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> teaches us, that <hi>the Goſpel is not in the word, but in the ſence; not in the bark, but in the ſapp, not in the leaves of the words, but in the root of the meaning;</hi> whence the 6.

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not therfore follow humane ſence, judgment or opinion; neither will I for the preſent, make uſe of Schoolmen, nor of the Doctors or learned men for almoſt twelve hundred years, which without doubt, may

               <p>It was a bold ſaying of this Doctor in his 12.

Again in the ſame place he ſays,</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt our lord and God, he the high prieſt of God the Father, firſt offered Sacrifice to God the Father, and commanded this to be done in his commemoration: verily the prieſt executes in the ſtead of Chriſt, who imitates that which Chriſt did do and offers a true and full ſacrifice in the Church to God the Father, if he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to offer according to that which he has ſeen
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58254:13"/>Chriſt himſelf to have offered. <hi>Laſtly in</hi> Ser. de coena Domini, <hi>which is commonly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him:</hi> ſith our lord has ſaid.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The ſacrifice of the Maſs proved by Tradition and practiſe of the Church, within the five hundred years after Chriſt.</head>
               <p>SAint <hi>Auguſtine Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>ad Januarium.</hi> cap. 5. affirms, that whatſoever the Church in all the world uſes, carries with it full authority: inſomuch that to diſpute whether it might be done; is moſt inſolent madneſs: and <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Creſconium</hi> c. 33. to do that, which the whole Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; cannot be queſtioned, for as the holy Scripture cannot deceive us; ſo he who fears to be deceived, by the obſcurity of any queſtion, let him conſult of it, the Church, which without any ambiguity, the Scripture demonſtrates or makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
               <p>Let us therfore now ſee what hath been the Doctrine of the Church within theſe 500. years after Chriſt, wherto as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctour appeals.</p>
               <p>This cannot be made more manifeſt then by the Tradition and practiſe of the Church, in her Liturgies or Maſſes, for what the Grecians call liturgies, that the Latin calls <hi>Miſſa,</hi> and we in Engliſh Maſs. Now theſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58254:15"/>Liturgies do come from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and others of thoſe times, and within the times from five hundred years, we hardly find any forms of Maſſes; but what are deduced from them: I will not ſay but that there have been ſome difference in their rites or ceremonies, ſome diminutions and ſome additions, yet none of them differ in the ſubſtance or nature of a ſacrifice, all agree in their forms, in as much as concerns the due celebration of the Maſs. Now becauſe the Doctour alledges the Liturgies of S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> I ſhall take a brief view of theſe in particular.</p>

                  <p>SAint <hi>Proclus Biſhop of Conſtantinople,</hi> l. <hi>de Traditione divina Liturgiae,</hi> about the year 430. aſſures us, that amongſt the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, S. <hi>James</hi> did ſet forth a form of liturgie or Maſs; which <hi>Baronius ad an.</hi> 63. confirms, out of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt.</hi> 6. <hi>an.</hi> 365. who <hi>Catch.</hi> 5. explicates the moſt part of S. <hi>James</hi> Liturgie, as of the <hi>pax</hi> or, <hi>kiſſe of peace,</hi> the <hi>ſurſum corda;</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; the cherubical hymn, ſanctus ſanctus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> prayers before the conſecration; In which, ſays he, <hi>we pray our moſt benign God, that he would ſend his ſpirit on what is ſet before
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58254:15"/>us, that he indeed would make this bread, Chriſt's body, and the wine Chriſt's bloud: for what the holy Ghoſt teaches is altogether ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and tranſmuted; but then when that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſacrifice is made, we pray for the living and dead, &amp;c.</hi> all which is found in S. <hi>James</hi> liturgie. S. <hi>Dioniſe</hi> and S. <hi>Clement</hi> have made the deſcription of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Maſs, where are many things alſo like to thoſe of S. <hi>James,</hi> and what now are in uſe in the Latine Church, S. <hi>Epiphanius an.</hi> 370. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 79. calls S. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Principal leader of the Myſteries and ſacrifice.</hi> For the ſatifaction of the Reader I ſhall make a brief obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what I find in his liturgie, as I find it in <hi>Claudius de ſanctis,</hi> printed 111. years paſt.</p>
                  <p>The glorious Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi> compoſed for his people of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> his liturgie or Maſs, wherin he frequently calls it <hi>a divine and ſuperceleſtial myſterie; a ſacred and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Myſterie, made at the holy Altar; a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and incruental or</hi> unbloudy <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> In which commemoration is made of the <hi>moſt holy Immaculate, our moſt glorious lady Mother of God and alwaies Virgin Mary,</hi> with all the ſaints and Juſt; in another place, he has the ſame, concluding <hi>that by their prayers and interceſſion we may obtaine Mercy.</hi> In another place the Prieſt prayes; that <hi>he would grant that this our Oblation may be grateful
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58254:16"/>acceptable, ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt; for the propitiation of our ſins, and for the Reſt of our friends who have ſlept before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before; <hi>we ask of our Lord, the Angel of peace our faithful guide keeper of our ſouls and bodies;</hi> the <hi>Catechumens</hi> and others are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed: then the prieſt, uſes <hi>Incenſe,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Receive, O Lord from our hands who are ſinners this Incenſe as thou didſt receive thoſe things which</hi> Abel, Noe, Aaron <hi>and</hi> Samuel, <hi>and all thy ſaints have offered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let all humane and mortal fleſh be ſilent, and ſtand with fear and trembling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template with it ſelf no terrene thing, for the King of kings, and Lord of lords, Chriſt our God comes forth to be Immolated: and given for food to the faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſecration is the ſame with ſome little difference with that of the Roman Maſs, and in the prayer following, <hi>We offer to thee, O Lord, this venerable and incruental ſacrifice;</hi> and a little after, <hi>let his deſcending, holy and good and glorious preſence, ſanctifie and make this bread, the holy body of thy Chriſt and this Chalice the precious bloud of thy Chriſt, and when</hi> he breaks the bread he puts <hi>part into the Chalice,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The union of the moſt holy body &amp; precious bloud of our Lord and God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before Communion he has this prayer, <hi>O Lord our God, celeſtial bread, life of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58254:16"/>I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be made partaker of thy immaculate myſteries, but thou as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, make me worthy by thy grace, that without damnation I may be partaker of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body and precious bloud, unto remiſſion of ſins and life everlasting:</hi> and after; <hi>We give thee thanks O Chriſt our God for that thou haſt vouchſafed us, to be made partakers of thy body and blond in remiſſion of ſins, and to eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, he that peruſes this Maſs of S. <hi>James,</hi> may find moſt things which are in uſe in the Roman Church, as <hi>Incenſing the Altar, Salutation of the people with</hi> Pax vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, <hi>or peace be with you, at leaſt</hi> 7. <hi>times,</hi> the oracles of the Old Teſtament and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the new, for which now is <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel, Domine miſerere,</hi> or, <hi>kirye elei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at leaſt</hi> 15. <hi>times;</hi> the <hi>Gloria in excelſis, Creed, and our Lords prayer: Inelination at the prayers, often ſigning the gifts with the ſign of the Croſs, and diſmiſſion of the people with benediction.</hi> I cannot omit that in the Conſecration of the Chalice, the Apoſtle particularly declares that the wine ſhould be mingled with water: from theſe we may fee what the Maſs was in thoſe Apoſtolical times.</p>

                  <p>SAint <hi>Proclus</hi> aforeſaid ſays, that many more divine Paſtors who ſucceeded the Apoſtles and Doctours of the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the reaſon of the holy Myſteries, of that divine Liturgie or Maſs, have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and committed it in writing, and then naming S. <hi>Clement</hi> and S. <hi>James:</hi> but Great S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſeeing the ſlouth and negligence of men, and that they thought of nothing but terrene, and abject things, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were weary of long Maſs, not that he thought it to contain any ſuperfluous thing, or over-long, but to preſcind the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſlackneſs of the Prayers, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: for that they ſpent much time therein, he gave a ſhorter to be recited; for after that our Saviour was aſſumpted into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Apoſtles before they were diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the whole earth, aſſembling with conſpiring minds, were converted to prayer, the whole day, and when they found much conſo lation to be placed in the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſacrifice of our Lords body, they did ſing the liturgie or Maſs, abundantly and long prayer: Since they eſteemed theſe divine ſacred things joined together was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other things; and they were inflamed with a greater ſtudy and deſire of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58254:17"/>divine things, and the holy ſacrifice, and earneſtly embraced it, which they alwaies had in memory, the word of our Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my body, and do ye this in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration: and he who eats my fleſh, and drinks my bloud, abides in me, and I in him:</hi> wherefore alſo with a contrite heart they did ſing many prayers, vehemently implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the divine Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by theſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they expected the comming of the holy Ghoſt, that by his divine preſence he would make the bread and wine mixt with water, ordained for the ſacrifice, the very body and bloud of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious rite verily is obſerved to this very time, and ſhall flouriſh even to the end of the world. I have the more willingly reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the words of this holy Biſhop, highly commended by St. <hi>Cyril</hi> a Grecian, and teaching purpoſely of the divine liturgie or Maſs, and explicating it in each particular, according to the two liturgies or Maſs of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> not much more then 30. years, after S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> had compoſed his form of Maſs.</p>
                  <p>In this Maſs of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> we find moſt of thoſe things mentioned before, in that of S. <hi>James,</hi> and frequent memory of our <hi>bleſſed Lady, of the moſt holy our undeſiled Lady, Mother of God, and alwaies Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>with all the ſaints;</hi> And in a prayer before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58254:18"/>the hymn, <hi>Sanctify our ſouls and bodies, and give us grace to ſerve thee in ſanctity all our dayes, by the interceſſion of the holy Mother of God, and all ſaints, who have glorifyed thee from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Biſhop in ſecret, prays, <hi>Reeceive us, approching to thy holy Altar, according to the multitude of thy mercyes, that we may be worthy to offer to thee, that rational and unbloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſins, and ignorance of the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſecration is ſome what different, but by the action and words of our Saviour; after which, the Biſhop prayes in ſecret, <hi>Therefore O moſt holy Lord we alſo ſinners and they unworthy ſervants, who are ordained to miniſter at thy Altat; not for our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for we have not done any thing good on earth; but for thy mercies and miſerations, which thou haſt abundantly poured on us, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding draw near to thy holy Altar; propounding the things conſigurating the holy body and bloud of thy Chriſt: we beſeech thee, and ask thee, O holy of holies, that by thy wel-plenſing benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thy holy ſpirit may comt upon us, and on theſe guifts which are ſet before us, to bleſs and ſanctifie them, and declare this bread to be the honour able body of our Lord God and Suvicur jeſu Chriſt, and that which is in the Chalice, the very bloud of our Lord God and our Saviout Jeſu Chriſt, which is ſhed for the life of the world.</hi>

               <p>367.

               <p>239.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58254:21"/>that when the Prieſts conſecrated the holy Myſteries in the time of the Maſſes, if it happened by any accident of ſickneſſe that the Myſtery began, could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, it ſhould be ſupplyed by ſome other Prieſt: Again, he ordained that none ſhould preſume to celebrate Maſs after meat or drink, how little ſoever it were, as alſo that none of the Prieſts ſhould preſume to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the ſolemnity of Maſſes, without two being preſent to anſwer him.</p>

               <p>121. <hi>Alexander</hi> Pope and Martyr, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>ad omnes orthod.</hi> ſayes, <hi>Veritie it ſelf, has inſtructed us to offer the Chalice and bread in the Sacrament, when he ſaid, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed, and gave to his Diſciples, ſaying, take ye and eat, for this is my body,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58254:21"/>which is delivered for you; In like manner the Chalice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for by theſe ſacrifices offered to our Lord crimes and ſinns are blotted out; and therefore his Paſſion is to be remembred where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are redeemed, and often recited, and theſe offered to our Lord; our Lord is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pleaſed with ſuch hoſts and great ſins are demitted; for can there be in ſacrifices a greater thing, then the body and bloud of Chriſt? Neither can there be any Oblation better then this, for this excells all, which is to be offered to our Lord, with a pure conſcience, and to be taken with a pure minde, and to be honoured by all,; and as it is better then all other; ſo it ought rather to be honoured and worſhiped.</hi> The ſame Saint ſayes, <hi>In the Oblation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which are offered within the ſolemnity of Maſſes, the Paſſion of our Lord is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Paſſion of him whoſe body and bloud is made may be celebrated; ſo that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide all ſuperſtitious opinions, Bread only and wine, mixed with water are to be offered in the ſacrifice, for (as we have received from our Fathers and reaſon it ſelf teaches) wine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone or water alone is not to be offered in the Chalice of our Lord but both mixt, becauſe we reade, that both did flow from his ſide in his Paſſion.</hi>

                  <p>But what makes more to our purpoſe, the ſame is gathered out of three of the firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels, which the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> admits, now in their Articles. In the 4. General Councel of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> Act. 3. Bleſſed <hi>Iſchirion</hi> Martyr accuſed <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (251.) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58254:23"/>other things, he had taken away the wheat that was ſent by the Emperour to the Church of <hi>Libia;</hi> for to make the Euchariſt, that <hi>by that occaſion the Incruent al ſacrifice of the Maſs, was not for long time offered:</hi> he adds moreover, that thoſe goods which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſopia</hi> a moſt noble woman, had bequeathed by Teſtament to Monaſteries, and to the poor, to the end that <hi>the ſacrifice might be offered for the health of her ſoul,</hi> he had given to prophane perſons; ſure theſe actions were then eſteemed great Crimes; or elſe, he durſt not to have preſumed to propound them in the face of ſo great a Councel.</p>
                  <p>431. In the great Councel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> Patriarck of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and ſynod of that place to <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> was read <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and highly approved, and commended, as agreeable to the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> or <hi>containing nothing ambiguous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſſentaneous, but agreeing to our ſetled faith, without any noveltie.</hi> Now this Epiſtle was a profeſſion of the Catholick faith, and to our purpoſe in theſe terms; <hi>Announcing the death of the only born Son of God, that of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the fleſh, and his Reſurrection, and in like manner, confeſſing his aſcenſion into the heavens; we celebrate in the Churches; the incruental verity of ſacrifice; ſo alſo we come to the Myſtical Benedictions, and are ſanctified and made partakers of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58254:24"/>holy body, and precious bloud of Chriſt, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of all of us; not receiving as common fleſh (farr be it) nor as of a ſanctified man, and as of one joined to the word, according to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dignity or of one poſſeſſing the divine habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but as truely life-giving and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the word it ſelf, being life naturally as God, for he is united to proper fleſh, and has declared that to be life-giving, and therefore as he ſaid to us, Amen, Amen, I ſay to you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, and drink his bloud; yet we ought not to think that to be as a man one of us (for how can the fleſh of man according to his nature be life-giving?) but truly made proper to him, who for us, both is and is called the ſon of man;</hi> I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but that this was then the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the whole Church, when from this Myſtery of the Maſs they proved the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>325. I ſhall conclude with the 18. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the firſt General Councel held at <hi>Nice,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That there was brought to the holy &amp; great Council, that in ſome places and Citties, the Deacons did give the Grace of holy Communion to Prieſts; which neither Rule, nor cuſtome, hath delivered, that thoſe who offer Chriſts body, ſhould receive from them who have no power to offer,</hi> alſo it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſome Deacons did touch the holy thing offered, (that is the Euchariſt) before the biſhops.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Sacrifice neceſſary to the being of a Church.</head>
               <p>THere can be no viſible Church without viſible Religion, nor no viſible Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without a viſible Sacrifice: for as the Church is nothing but a viſible congregation of all the faithful, ſo it is neceſſary that in this Aſſembly or Congregation, there be ſomething, that may manifeſt the ir murual deſire and concord to worſhip God. Now it is certain that there never could be any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to any internal action, neither could there be any publick act of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the worſhip of God, unleſs they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled did agree, or follow ſome external ſign, voice, or action, ſuch as Sacraments and ſacrifices are.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well notes, <hi>hom.</hi> 60. <hi>ad Pop. Antioch. If we had been incorporeal, God would have given us plain and incorporeal gifts; but becauſe the ſoul is conjoyned to the body, he has given us intelligible things, in ſenſible;</hi> and this conformable to humane nature which depends of the ſenſes in her operations; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the worſhip of God, whereto the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Religion conduces us.</p>
               <p>Now Religion includes four Acts: The firſt is, a conſideration of Gods infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58254:30"/>on whom all things depend. 2. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on our nothing, for of our ſelves we are nothing have nothing, and can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but whatſoever we have or can do, comes all from God; Theſe two acts are not elicited by the vertue of Religion, but as ſuppoſed grounds or motives, to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: the other two proper acts of Religion are interiour or exteriour: the firſt as pure, is proper only to the Angells, and Bleſſed ſouls, now ſeparated from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or elevated by ſome ſupernatural grace; but as it is found in Men of this world, has dependence on the ſenſes, but may be purified in its operation, and is a profound ſubmiſſion of heart or internal Inclination of the mind to ſerve and worſhip God: The external act of Religion, is an external profeſſion of that interiour will, made by voice, geſture, or external ſign; ſuch are publick prayer, adorations, and ſuch like, but none like to the ſacrifice; which carries with it that true worſhip, which S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> l: 10. <hi>de civitate Dci,</hi> cap. 1: calls <hi>Latria,</hi> or, <hi>honour due to God:</hi> A little after, <hi>Religion ſignifies nothing ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as the worſhip of God, by which</hi> cap. 4. <hi>we owe ſacrifioe to God,</hi> and thence inferrs, <hi>There is none dare ſay, a ſacrifice is due, but to God alone, and who ever ſacrificed but to him, whom he knew, or imagined or feigned to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58254:30"/>God:</hi> whence I infer, That ſince from the firſt creation of Man, God had a Church, wherein there was true Religion, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that according to our humane conſtitution, in the ſame Church there was and is an external ſacrifice, wherein God, was and is worſhipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> which is the perfect act of Religion and worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſacrifices ſeem to follow the inſtinct of Nature, for as <hi>Plutark, adverſus Colos</hi> ſayes, <hi>A man may find Cities without walls, houſes, Kings, Laws, Coynes, ſchools, and Theatres; but a Town without Temples, and Gods, to whom ſacrifices are offered, you ſhall never finde. Plato,</hi> before him, <hi>de leg. Dial. We can never finde any Nation ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, any people at all ſo rude, and ſavage, who with vows, victins, and outward ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have not acknowledged the Soveraeignty of ſome God or other.</hi> All Hyſteries do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that from the beginning of the world ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were in uſe amongſt all Nations and Religion: whence S. <hi>Auguſtine, Epiſt.</hi> 49. <hi>ad Deograt,</hi> 9.34. <hi>That, it is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the rites of Pagans, that they builded Temples, ordained Prieſts, offered ſacrifices</hi> (for he ſuppoſed theſe to be according to the law of nature) <hi>but that theſe were exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to Idols, and devills, that was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for that they gave which was only due
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58254:31"/>to God, to falſe Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what makes more to our purpoſe, is, the continual practiſe of Gods Church even from the beginning of uſing ſacrifices, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> lib. 10. <hi>de civit. Dei. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>How ancient apart of Gods worſhip, a ſacrifice is,</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Abel <hi>do ſhew full proof; and all along in the law of Nature the Examples of</hi> Noe, Abraham, Melchiſedech <hi>and</hi> Jacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>now the written Law had ſacrifices ordained by God himſelf, which continued to our Saviour,</hi> to ſay then, that the law of Grace ſhould have no ſacrifice, is to deprive Chriſts Church of the moſt noble act of Religion; and ſo make it more imperfect, then the law of Nature or Written law.</p>
               <p>I know ſome will object that of S. <hi>John Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>God is a ſpirit, and they that adore him; muſt adore in ſpirit and verity;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwer, that this place manifeſts, that our ſacrifices are ſpiritual, and true, in which they differ from all precedent ſacrifices, which were carnal, and rather in figure or ſhadow of the ſacrifice of the new law: It is certain therefore, that Chriſt did not reject all external worſhip of God, but would have them done in ſpirit and truth; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take away all ſacrifices, Sacraments, prayers, Churches, and ſociety of men in his ſervice. The ſacrifice of the new law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be done in ſpirit (that is) in ſaith,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58254:31"/>hope, charitie, and interiour devotion; and in veritie according to the inſtitution of Chriſt. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 6. invites us <hi>to pray at all times in ſpirit,</hi> that is, in mind, affection and deſire, or as <hi>Vatablus</hi> terms it, In ſpirit, that is, with ſervour of ſpirit, that is, with an Intimate and fervent ſpirit, otherwiſe it works no true act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whoſe external act requires alſo the internal: as has been ſaid already.</p>
               <p>Our Advarſaries have ſought all means poſſible to take away the belief of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, notwithſtanding that Chriſts Church, as I have formerly manifeſted, has alwaies taught and believed it as proper to the Evangelical law.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Doctours Invention to exclude the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs.</head>
               <p>SOme of our advarſaries have ſaid, That the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, is the peculiar and perpetual hoſt, in which our Prieſthood, law, and Religion is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: and ſo in the new law, there is no other ſacrifice remaining, the Doctour in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58254:32"/>proof of this, lays hold on the Apoſtles words; Heb. 7. <hi>Chriſt did once offer himſelf,</hi> cap. 9. <hi>once in the conſummation of the world;</hi> and again <hi>Chriſt was offered once:</hi> It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe then to frame another ſacrifice. I anſwer by granting the Antecedent; and denying the conſequence, for the ſacrifice of the Croſs, was both full and ſufficient; nothing was wanting to the value, and ſufficiency of the price; for Chriſt, by his paſſion, has purchaſed the ſufficient price for to redeem the whole world: yea for all the ſins ever committed, either before or after, for it was an expiatorie, Redeeming, and ſatisfactorie Sacrifice; for the whole world, by which the Sacrifice of the Maſs is not excluded; for the Maſs is only applicatorie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and ſatisfaction, which Chriſt did work on the Croſs; ſo that in the Maſs, we do not offer a new price for our ſinns, but we apply the former price of the Croſs, to our ſelves; even as we apply the ſame to us, by baptiſm, and other Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſacrifice of the Maſs, may be ſaid to be the ſame with that of the Croſs; in as much as it is a continual repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the paſſion; whence S. <hi>Cyprian, Epiſt.</hi> 63. ſayes, <hi>Our ſacrifice is correſpondent to the paſſion of Chriſt:</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> de fid. <hi>ad</hi> Pet. Cap. 19. <hi>Thoſe carnal ſacrifices did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate the fleſh of Chriſt which he was to offer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58254:32"/>for ſinns; and the bloud which he was to ſhed; But this ſacrifice, is the commemoration of the fleſh of Chriſt which he has now given: and of the bloud which he has ſhedd: In them he was ſhewed as to be killed, in this he is ſhewed as killed.</hi> Again, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the place before cited, ſayes, we make mention of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in all our ſacrifices (for the paſſion of our Lord is the ſacrifice which we offer) we ought to do no other thing, but what he did, for the Scripture ſays; as often as you ſhall eat this bread, and drink this Chalice, you ſhall ſhew the death of our Lord untill he comes; as often therefore, as we offer the Chalice in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Lord and of his paſſion, we doe that which manifeſtly our Lord did;</hi> In fine, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe is the ſame with the ſacrifice of the Croſs; for that in the Maſs, as well as on the Croſs, the ſame principal prieſt, and the ſame offerer, to wit, Chriſt, is both the ſame victime, and hoſt, different only in the manner, <hi>Incruentall</hi> in the Maſs, <hi>Cruentall</hi> on the Croſs; but the Incruentall in the Maſs ſignifies and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents in a myſteriall manner; the cruental on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore once dyed for all, with all ſufficiency imaginable: but all do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit thereof, only thoſe who by grace of God, are made partakers thereof, receive the fruit of Chriſts paſſion; and we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58254:33"/>are made participant of this all-ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; by ſuch means as Chriſt has leſt in his Church, amongſt which the chiefeſt are the Sacraments &amp; ſacrifice of the Euchariſt, as the principal means to apply the merit of Chriſts paſſion unto us, which Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in his laſt ſupper, according to the faith, belief, and doctrine of Chriſts Church; even within theſe five hundred years after Chriſt, as is formerly declared.</p>
               <p>Others will admit of ſome ſacrifices: but they muſt be purely ſpirituall, ſuch as are the ſacrifices of praiſe, of contrition, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and ſuch like, as if they were all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and celeſtiall; but our omnipotent God, condeſcending to our humane nature, and for the general conſervation of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the hearts of men, has alwaies or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained certain viſible ſignes, ſacraments, and rites, for to move our interiour minde to ſuch pious duties, as is manifeſt in all ſtates of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this is beſides our queſtion, for we require a ſacrifice which is proper and peculiar to the new teſtament, or Law, which was ordained by Chriſt: ſuch as are mentioned, are common to all laws; if you take them purely ſpiritual; to no law: for ſuch belong only to celeſtiall ſpirits, but if we take them as united to viſible ſigns; then ſuch ſacrifices were found in the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58254:33"/>as in the written laws, nay there were ſeveral ſacrifices in all. The primary Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was to exhibite due worſhip to God, and in particular ſome were for expiation of ſin, ſome with thanksgiving, other in praiſe of God; in like manner in the law of Grace there are ſuch ſacrifices, but the only true and proper ſacrifice of the Evangelical law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt; which as it ſucceeded all the ſacrifices of the old law, ſo it hath in a more excellent manner their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>Contrary to this, Doctour <hi>Brevent</hi> cites S. <hi>Auguſtine, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de civit. Dei, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work tending to effect our beatitude by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere inherence with God is a true ſacrifice.</hi> To which I ſay, that in a general ſenſe it is true, eſpecially if it be taken in metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe, as 8. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> plainly here takes it; as it appears in the examples here alledged. <hi>A ſacrifice,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>though offered by a man, is a divine thing, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a man conſecrated wholly to Gods name, to live to him, and die to the world, is a ſacrifice.</hi> 2. <hi>when we chaſtiſe our bodie, by abſtinence, it is a ſacrifice.</hi> 3. <hi>works of mercy being referred to God, are true ſacrifices:</hi> We Catholicks do confeſſe and acknowledge thoſe, and ſuch, to be metaphorical, improperly, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſence, true ſacrifices; but Proteſtants will not only deny them to be proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58254:34"/>but alſo will not believe them, to be ſacrifices at all, for they will not allow the two firſt, to be acts of vertue, and the beſt word they will give them is, that they are effects, and fruits of Popery.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Saint in the ſame place, inſinnuates another <hi>ſacrifice, by which the whole and holy ſociety of the redeemed, and ſanctified City is offered to God; by that great Prieſt, who gave up his life for us to become members of ſo great a head, in ſo mean a form, this form he offered, and herein he was offered, in this, he is our Prieſt, our Mediatour, and our ſacrifice, all in this;</hi> and after, concludes, <hi>This is the Chriſtians ſacrifice, we are one body with Chriſt, as the Church celebrateth, in the Sacrament of the Altar, ſo well known to the faithful.</hi> This alone is the proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſacrifice, which Chriſt has inſtituted, and left in his Church; as formerly hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>But our Doctour, to prove his conceit; <hi>cap.</hi> 11. towards the end; cites <hi>Durandus,</hi> l. 2. <hi>de ſacerd.</hi> fol. 29. which is <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>In fine,</hi> The Doctours words are; <hi>Durand himſelf is full of this</hi> (that is, to prove the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Croſs) <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>performed excellently the office of a prieſt; when he offered himſelf on the Croſs, for the ſins of Mankind, and performs it yet more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly now, when ſitting at the right hand of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58254:34"/>Father, he intercedes continually for us.</hi> We acknowledge this as Catholick doctrine, for this is true: but no way excluding the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs; but with the ſame <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> in the precedent words, <hi>this Office</hi> (to wit of prieſt) <hi>Chriſt did exerciſe, when after ſupper he converted the bread and wine, into his body and bloud, ſaying to the Apoſtles, Take ye, and eat this is my body.</hi> The Doctor omitted this either ignorantly or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. It hardly can be believed, but that he did read the place, except he took it from others notes, and ſo little cared for the truth; if he did, little credit is to be given to what he ſays; God defend us from ſuch Doctors.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange how the Doctor in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his 3. <hi>chapter.</hi> ſhould acknowledg that the Maſs; according to the primary No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it was anciently taken, for that part of divine worſhip, where the elements of bread and wine were by the prieſt, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God, and diſtributed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which is, the ſupper of our Lord in S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 11.20. for this he cites, <hi>Ordo Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> made by <hi>Gelaſius;</hi> and reprinted in <hi>Rome,</hi> 1591. or thereabouts; whereby is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, the Conformity of the Preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, with the Church in thoſe primitive times for this ſacrifice for which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to wit, that we take it even in this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58254:35"/>Notion he aſſignes, and accordingly imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the primitive Church, not inventing any new Maſs, but continuing ſtill the ſame. I could not but ſmile when for this he alledges <hi>Durandus</hi> for <hi>legitima Miſſa, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 39. and interprets it <hi>the only due and lawful adminiſtration of the holy Sacrament in the old latin Church:</hi> whereas <hi>Durand</hi> interpreteth that to be a legitimate Maſs, in which are Prieſt and reſpondent, offerer and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, as the compoſition of the prayers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, this by evident reaſon; perhaps he means the order and manner of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Maſs: which <hi>Durand</hi> doth learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolidly declare, in every particular particle of the Maſs, which if the Doctour beleives, as he does his <hi>legitima Miſſa,</hi> he labours in vain againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion in that place propounded, was, whether a Prieſt might celebrate Maſs, when leſs then two were preſent; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſputing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> he concludes, That is a lawful Maſs, which hath one preſent, beſides the Prieſt at Maſs, O how much is this to the Doctours purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now the Doctour will ſolve all, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſtead of the ſucrifice of the Maſs, Chriſtian duties, as evidently true Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Oblations, and ſacrifices; which in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to publick worſhip, were made before Communion, and which the holy Fathers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58254:35"/>commend as the general Chriſtian ſacrifice, that ſucceeded Jewiſh offerings, which he confirms by a prayer which he finds in the Roman Miſſal, <hi>Dom.</hi> 5. <hi>poſt Pentecoſten.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that ſuch Oblations were made in the time of Maſs; at the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; as is declared in the Liturgical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. which alſo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in the 4. Canon of the Apoſtles; in theſe words, <hi>It it not lawful to offer at the Altar, beſides new corn and grapes and oyle for the lamps, and perfumes, that is, Incenſe, in the time, wherein the holy oblation is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated;</hi> many ancient Canons have been made, concerning theſe oblations; in all which we may ſee that theſe oblations were of things, which belonged to the Sacrifice, or to the things which belonged to the Altar, or to the poor, and ſometimes to the Prieſts, by way of Alms, the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> takes it in the fence of Alms, and only prayes for the givers; but never thought it as an eſſential point of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which may be diſtributed without alms, as alms may be given without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Add to this, that ſuch Oblations are common to the old law, and yet were never reckoned amongſt the ſacrifices; <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. a law is made, <hi>There ſhall not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord, any empty, but every one ſhall offer, according to that he hath; but</hi> this was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58254:36"/>not by way of ſacrificing which only did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Prieſts. In the new law S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. calls them <hi>Collections,</hi> S. <hi>Clement</hi> l. 4. <hi>conſtit. Apoſtol. cap.</hi> 7. ſuppoſes this when <hi>he adviſes the Prieſt to refuſe at the Altar the Oblations which come from an ill conſcience:</hi> Pope <hi>Fabian an.</hi> 239. <hi>Decreed, that on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days men and women ſhould make offerings of bread and wine.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian blames the rich miſers of his time who brought nothing to this offering:</hi> ſaying, <hi>Doſt thou who art wealthy and rich think to have part of the Maſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vouchſafing to put any thing into the baſon? Tertullian</hi> calls ſuch Oblations <hi>pledges of piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, taking the prayer of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in that ſence which the Doctor takes it; the moſt that can be gathered thence, is, that ſuch oblations, were made in the time of Maſs, for that prayer immediatly follows the offertory: but it may be better expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the oblations, which the people do make of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, together with the Prieſt, as it is ſaid in the firſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> of the Maſs, in which, the Prieſt prays for all who are preſent, ſaying, <hi>for whom we offer to thee,</hi> or, <hi>who do offer to thee this ſacrifice.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Doctours deceitful proceeding in his citations.</head>
               <p>THe Doctour to ſhew his great Reading, in every page almoſt, cites ſchoolmen, Fathers, Liturgies, and Councils; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that all thoſe ſchoolmen, were members and profeſſours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; all of them taught the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs; I cannot concieve any reaſon, why he ſhould alledge <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for his fooliſh conceits; unleſs he had dreamt that no man would take the pains to read their works; for if they did, they ſhould eaſily ſee his legerdemain, nay, I can ſcarcely believe, that the Doctor himſelf ever read them, in the Authours themſelves, but perhaps truſted to ſome others notes; verily a man need not go any further, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all his impertinencies; then to read the places he cites; for either they were of his opinion or no; if they were not, as it is certain they were not, who can excuſe his moſt perverſe malice, who with neglect of their grounds, for the ſacrifice of the Maſs; and anſwers to all his objections: If they were not, ſtrange madneſs poſſeſſed them, that they all of them ſhould ſo amply, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58254:37"/>ſo copiouſly write, preach, and teach this catholick Doctrine: <hi>Alcuinus, Ordo Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Durandus, Walfridus, Honorius, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel, Ceremonialt,</hi> and <hi>Pontificale Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Vega,</hi> &amp;c. whom the Doctour cites, have written whole books, believing and proving not only the ſubſtance of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Maſs, but alſo every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, manner, and rite and ceremony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; all theſe Schoolmen were Prieſts or Biſhops ordained in the Roman Church; yea many were Cardinals.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange, that the Doctour ſhould quote ſuch men when he confeſſes that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, had almoſt twelve hundred years been poſſeſſed of the Maſs; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed as ſhe now doth; the moſt that we may expect, from his innumerable citations is, that he has ſcraped and culled ſome half ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, ſome ſlips of words, wherein I will not excuſe all, neither are we bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or believe all they ſay, we much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them as true Children of the Church, and as faithful Expoſitours of the Myſteries of our faith, with ſubmiſſion to their lawful Prelates.</p>
               <p>But I freely accuſe the fraudulent dealing of taking words and ſentences contrary to their own judgment; and minde; yea their own words, and abſolutely contrary to their manifeſt and known doctrine, meerly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58254:37"/>the Chriſtian Readers: I dare ſay; that if the Doctour himſelf; or any other, would ſtand to their judgments, the Doctor would looſe his cauſe; for they were conſtant, Champions, and defenders of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith; even in this ſacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it is not my task here; to defend or reprove what has been ſaid, or taught in the Church, from the firſt five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; I will let the Doctor alone in his career, and enquire, what others will ſay of his great impertinencies: But becauſe he has the boldneſs to quote the Liturgies or Maſſes of S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> which were within thoſe five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; I muſt ſay, that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted way, to take teſtimony of Maſſes, againſt the Maſs; eſpecially when all he has ſaid, in every reſpect, is as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Maſs, of S. <hi>James,</hi> of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> as againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs; for in ſubſtance of a ſacrifice of the new law, they are all one: as I have formerly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Yet, I cannot but note, that the Doctor <hi>pag</hi> 20. produces a prayer uſed in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; <hi>That according to our Saviours merciful inſtitution, God would be pleaſed to ſend down on theſe Sacraments, the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo ſanctify them; that they may be the pretious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the pretious bloud of his Son, to them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58254:38"/>who ſhould receive worthily,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>As for the holy Fathers, he frequently quotes them, but ſeldom their words, at leaſt any way contradicting the Catholick

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of two groſs Miſtakes committed by the Doctor.</head>
               <p>THe Doctor either out of Ignorance or perverſe malice in his third chap. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58254:39"/>ſo in other places, attributes to the Roman Church the ſacrificing of their God; which if he believes, he ſhews his ignorance in a high degree, if not, what may excuſe him? for he cannot but know, that the ſacrifice of the Maſs is no other, than that of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt Jeſus; and that it is offered as well to God the Son, as to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to God the Holy Ghoſt: and by his raillery all alone, he ſeems to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, but in this he imitated the ancient heathens, who upbraided the Chriſtians for that they did eat their God.</p>
               <p>But it is as fooliſh ſport, that he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to vilify the ſacrifice of the Maſs, out of the Roman Miſſall, which, (as he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly conceives) wholly deſtroys the eſſence and nature of this ſacrifice: for it ſhews, that there may be many defects, and abuſes committed in the uſe of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, Imagining that Chriſt may fall on the earth, be torn in pieces, eaten by catts and doggs, devoured by beaſts, corrupted and burnt, and that he lies there as a dead man, or as one on a dunghill, with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſuch like, frequently reiterated. It is true the Roman Miſſal mentions ſome ſuch abuſer, but by way of prevention, and to give the Doctor more ſcope, we will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that ſome ſuch abuſes have happened, either through caſuality, or negligence of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58254:39"/>thoſe whom it might concern, or by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of men, or inſtigation of the divell.</p>
               <p>I muſt alſo tell the Doctor, that he needs not talk ſo much of Chriſts being in ſo baſe and vile places; for I can tell him that there is no place, more vile, and baſe, nor more abhominable and odious, none more loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and ſtinking, then the mouth or ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of a ſinner: yet ſuch is the immenſe goodnes of Chriſt Jeſus, that he left this holy Sacrament to us, and permitted it to be taken by ſinners, otherwiſe the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>He that eateth this bread, or drinketh the Chalice of our Lord unworthily; eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf:</hi> S. <hi>Cryſoſtome</hi> on that place, ſayes, <hi>ſuch an one is guilty of our Lords death, as if he had killed our Lord, on ſhed his bloud.</hi> and in <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>by this ſin the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord is troden under foot,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian ſer. de coena Dom. Violence is offered to our Lords body, and by their mouth and hand our Lord is offended:</hi> The Doctor need not talk of Jakes or ſinks, for one ſhall hardly find, a more loathſome place then the ſtomack or belly of man. S. <hi>Cryſoſtome</hi> in <hi>Opere imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. in Mat.</hi> ſaid well, If <hi>thou compareſt an ill man to beaſts thou ſhalt ſind him worſe, yea, a wicked man is worſe then the devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With all this, or whatſoever can be ſaid of this kinde, none can be ſo fooliſh as to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58254:40"/>think, that Chriſts body or bloud ſuffers at all; in any ſuch abuſes or defects, for all ſuch happens, only in the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> for Chriſts body and bloud in the Euchariſt, is as a ſpirit by an indiviſible and ſecret manner; and ſo no more defiled then the ſoul of man is hurt, defiled or ſullied, by whatſoever filth, ordure or excrement the body is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; Chriſts body being now glorified is impaſſible, immutable, and unalterable, ſuffers no more, proportionably then the Deity, repleniſhing all places of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever, or how loathſom ſoever, whence one ſaid not amiſs, <hi>God who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature is no leſs, in the ſink, then in the heavens, cannot be hurt nor defiled.</hi> The body of Chriſt in heaven is impaſſible, notwithſtanding that he remains there with all his natural dimenſions; but in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt it is in a ſacramentall and ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; without any quantitative or corporal dimenſion, or ſituation, or ſenſitive motion; I believe the Doctor never underſtood theſe circumſtances, or if he did he makes himſelf a pratler, and contrary to his knowledge wilfully ſeeks to gull the people, who for the moſt part are ignorant of ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if ſuch ſcurrile arguments, may have place in divine things, may not the Infidel and Jews uſe the ſame againſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58254:40"/>Chriſt himſelf, nay, ſome have done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; ſaying, Can any Imagine <hi>Joſephs</hi> Son to be a God? was he not ſubject to all mankind Miſeries? he lay nine months as a priſoner in his Mothers womb, in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, was born in a loathſome ſtable, and as a childe might have been devoured by the wilde beaſts; as he might have been torn out of his mothers womb, ſome ſow or Swine might have eaten him, ſome raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wolf or other cruel beaſt might have torn him to peeces, He might have fallen into the ſaw-pit, ditch or pond, and ſo be made food for toads, frogs, or ſnakes, or other venemous beaſts; if drowned at Sea meat for fiſhes, they made difficulty alſo in that he was ſubject to the devil, who earried him too and fro at his pleaſure, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch like. If God then did permit his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon in perſon to be thus ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſualties, abuſes, and defects, what ſhall we wonder, that ſuch may or have followed him in the Euchariſt; Chriſt's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then was poſſible, and capable, yea, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of all imaginable abuſes, pains and cruelties of humane malice, or diabolical inventions; what wonder is it that God ſhould leave Chriſts body to ſuch accidental and extrinſecal abuſes, by which it receives no damage at all.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Doctor in alledging the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58254:41"/>Rubrick of the Roman Miſſal, does little conſider; that he gives no light argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; for in all times ſince Chriſt, there have been ſuch rules meerly to prevent ſuch abuſes and defects, as manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the ancient penitential Canons; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſeveral Decrees of Popes, and Councils beſides the great care, that no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Jews, or Hereticks ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Maſs: the continual care that the Church has always had, that the holy bloud ſhould not fall on the Altar or ground, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution, which Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 1. <hi>an.</hi> 158. ſet down in the Roman Miſſal, <hi>de defectibus,</hi> according to which S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hom. 21. <hi>Operis imperſ:</hi> in Mat. tells us, <hi>that it is not to be given to beaſts, or Infidels;</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> l. 50. Hom. 26. <hi>We obſerve with great care when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is adminiſtred to us, that nothing of it do fall out of our hands to the ground. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen hom.</hi> 13. in <hi>Exod. Ye that are accuſtomed to be preſent at the divine Myſtery, do know how when ye receive our Lords body, ye obſerve with great carefulneſs and veneration, leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the conſecrated gift ſhould fall down; for ye believe, and that rightly that ye are guilty, if any thing do fall, through your negligence.</hi> Surely all this care and folici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude could not be, but on ſome motives more then natural: for if there were only
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58254:41"/>pure bread and wine, they would have no more care of it, then the Proteſtants have in the Communion of bread and wine, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as I have proved before, the Church always believed, that the true body and bloud of Chriſt Jeſus was in the Euchariſt, they laboured by all convenient means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuch abuſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Doctors Raillery concerning Miracles wrought in the Sacrifice of the Maſs.</head>
               <p>THe Doctor very frequently ſcoffs and jears at the many Miracles which are wrought in the ſacrifice of the Maſs, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to diminiſh the credit and belief of it: whereas if they be Miracles, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude makes them not leſs to be Miracles: nay, if we will contemplate the works of God, and confider every particular, in one Miracle, we may finde many Miracles, which exceed all created power. For the ſatisfaction of the Reader, I ſhall illuſtrate it by examples. <hi>Exodus</hi> the 4. <hi>God converted</hi> Moſes <hi>his rod into a ſerpent,</hi> which without all doubt, was a great Miracle, which alſo carries with it many Miracles included therein; 1. the Rod was reduced to nothing, and 2. To the ſerpent then created, God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58254:42"/>gave motion, proportion, figure, and other qualities of a ſerpent; and in like manner turning this new created ſerpent, into a rod: the ſerpent was reduced to nothing, and the ſerpent was converted into a rod; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a new being, not by any created power, but by God himſelf, who alſo gave it colour, proportion, figure, and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with other properties, agreeable to the nature of a rod; ſo that there was a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſubſtantiation or converſion from one ſubſtance to another ſubſtance; and tranſmutations or converſions of accidents to other accidents, independently of any natural cauſe or action: and here we may note, that our wonderful God afterward gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> power to do the ſame, not by his humane vertue, or power, but by the power and gift of God, whereby alone <hi>Moſes</hi> as Gods Miniſters, and inſtrument did the ſame.</p>
               <p>In like manner, God did miraculouſly give to the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Manna, Exod.</hi> 16. and in it are contained many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 1. That it was in ſuch plenty that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day it was ſufficient for three Millions. 2. That every one how much, or how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, they gathered, had as much and no more then theother. 3. Every one received nouriſhment thereby, equally to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſavour, and appetite; The holy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58254:42"/>text ſayes, according to that which they were able to eat, 4. The <hi>Manna</hi> putrified the next day, excepting only the ſabbaoth day, when it did not putrify. 5. On the ſixth day the <hi>Manna</hi> was doubled, and was not to be found on the ſabaoth day. 6. <hi>Solomon ſap.</hi> 16. tells us, that <hi>God gave bread from heaven, without labour, having in it all delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the ſweetneſs of all taſts, ſerving every mans will, and was turned to what every one would.</hi> 7. God continued this <hi>Manna</hi> for 40. years and no more, 8. God preſerved this <hi>Manna</hi> in the Tabernacle for many ages.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>Manna</hi> which as our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>John.</hi> 6. teaches, was but a figure or ſign of the bread, which he was to give, to wit, his body and bloud, has ſo many maricles accompanyed it, why ſhould any reaſonable man wonder that ſo many Miracles ſhould accompany the celeſtial and divine <hi>Manna,</hi> eſpecially if they be neceſſarily annexed, to the nature of ſo great and ſo miraculous a Sacrament, wherein the body and bloud of our Saviour Chriſt is contained. The royal Peophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. cries out, <hi>God hath made a memory of his miraculous works, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and pittiful Lord, he hath given meat to them that fear him:</hi> which according to all Catholick Interpreters, is as much as to ſay, God hath left one moſt ſpecial and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58254:43"/>memory of all other benefits, to wit, his body and bloud, in a miraculous manner; as a memory of his Paſſion, and our Redemption, as the ſpiritual food, and ſubſtance of all ſouls, who rightly fear him: The greateſt Miracle is the Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or converſion of the bread, and wine into the body, and bloud of Chriſt (of which I ſhall ſpeak in place convenient) which with it carries neceſſarily many other Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as in the next Chapter I ſhall fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>There remain two difficulties which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Doctors Ignorance or malice: the firſt is, that the Doctor attributes all theſe Miracles to the Prieſts; as if it all were done by their power, according to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, wherein he grievouſly errs; as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhall declare: for with S. <hi>Auguſtine, l.</hi> 10. <hi>de civit. Dei, cap.</hi> 12. <hi>All Catholicks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all Miracles done by Angels or men, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done by Gods power, working in them:</hi> If then there be any Miracles, as no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can deny in the Euchariſt; it is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who works them by the Miniſtery of the Prieſts: even as I ſaid before, he did work miracles by his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 3. cured the lame man at the doors of the temple, but adviſes the people, that <hi>they ſhould not think, that he did it by his own power, or holineſs, but in the name or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58254:43"/>of</hi> Jeſus: ſo, the prieſts do not any of thoſe miraculous things, in the ſacrifice of the Maſs by any humane power; but by his miniſterial power received in his Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt himſelf doth effect them: ſo that the Doctors babling ſo often of Miracles wrought by the Romiſh prieſts, is but meer raillery or moſt baſe ignorance.</p>
               <p>The other as ignorant folly, is his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with reiteration, touching the Roman prieſt, bringing down Chriſts body from heaven, at his pleaſure; as though Chriſt in coming to the Euchariſt, did leave the right hand of his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which is a groſſe errour, for Chriſt is no leſs in heaven after the Conſecration then he was before the Conſecration: he is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill at the right hand of his Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Article of our Creed; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he is in the Sacrament; this indeed is a Miracle wrought only by Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power; this made S. <hi>Chryſoſtome, l.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſacerdot.</hi> to exclame, <hi>O Miracle: O benignity of God; he who ſitts above with the Father, in the ſame article of time, is often handled in the hands of all, and he delivers himſelf to thoſe who are deſirous to receive and embrace him. hom.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Epheſios,</hi> and <hi>hom.</hi> 61. <hi>ad populum</hi> Antioch; Alſo he ſays, <hi>As many of us, who communicate of the body of Chriſt, and taſte his bloud, let us conſider, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58254:44"/>we taſte the body, and taſte the bloud of him, who ſits in the celeſtials, and is adored by the Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their great Maſter <hi>Calvin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. cap.</hi> 17. ſays, <hi>In his ſupper he commands me to take eat and drink, under the ſymbols of bread and wine, his body and bloud; for although it may ſeem incredible, that in ſo great a diſtance of places (as heaven and earth) the fleſh of Chriſt, ſhould penetrate to us, that it may be meat for us, we muſt yet remember how much above our ſenſes, the ſecret power of the holy Ghoſt can ſhew it ſelf; that which our minde comprehendeth not, our faith conceives, the ſpirit truly joyns together, things locally ſeparated,</hi> ſect. 24. <hi>Nothing mooe incredible, that things ſo far diſtant and remote within the whole ſpace of heaven and earth, in the whole diſtances of places, are not only conjoyned, but alſo united.</hi>

               <p>By theſe authorities of the holy Fathers the faith of the Church in thoſe firſt five hundred years, is made manifeſt, ſo that none with reaſon, can doubt of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body and bloud in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; unleſs he will altogether diſſent from Chriſts Church, in thoſe primitive times; and ſay, that Chriſt never had a true Church upon earth; in which number Doctor <hi>Brevent</hi> is not to be reckoned, for he ingeniouſly admits a true Church for five hundred years after Chriſt, which admitted the real preſence, whereto the miracles, which he ſcoffingly rehearſes, do neceſſarily follow, (as I ſaid before) to the being of Chriſt Jeſus in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>To begin therefore with his firſt miracle, which is, that the bread is diſtroyed in a moment, pray cannot he who gives it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take it away when he pleaſes? did not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58254:48"/>the ſame God turning <hi>Lot's</hi> wife into a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ſalt, take away, or deſtroy, or bring to nothing, her humane form, and nature, in a moment? was not the form of <hi>Moſes</hi>

                  </gap>d nature and ſubſtance deſtroyed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? was not the water when Chriſt turned it into wine, wholly deſtroyed? moreover this deſtruction follows the nature of all converſions, either partial or total; no new form is introduced, but as the former is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; no total ſubſtance is produced, but when the total ſubſtance precedent is alſo deſtroyed. If then the body of Chriſt be by the power of the omnipotent God, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or produced in the place of bread (as the holy Catholick Church always taught us, according to the teſtimonies now alledged and this ſhall be more manifeſted in the Chapter of tranſubſtantiation) it neceſſarily follows that the precedent ſubſtance be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or brought to nothing: ſo that this deciſion, or not being of bread and wine; proceeds <hi>ex neceſſitate miraculi,</hi> from the real preſence of Chriſts body and bloud in the Bleſſed Sacrament, and ſo is no new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle but the ſame with the former.</p>
               <p>The ſecond miracle, which he jeers at, is, the being of the accidents of bread and wine without a ſubject; which is not only poſſible, but alſo is actually in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as is ſufficiently declared in the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical

               <p>Moreover, this miracle, neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Myſtery of the real preſence, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch</hi> as it is a ſacrament, for it would not be a ſacrament, if there were not, in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble form, the eſſence of a ſacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58254:49"/>in <hi>a viſible ſign, of ſome inviſible thing.</hi> The Euchariſt therefore being a ſacrament, and containing the inviſible body of Chriſt, neceſſarily requires a viſible ſigne.

               </p>
               <p>It was therefore moſt congruous to the divine providence, moſt agreeable to the nature of this myſtical ſacrament: and moſt proper to our humane nature, that Chriſt inſtituted this ſacrament under the form of bread, for as Chriſt is the true bread of life; ſo he gave us his body and bloud under the form of bread and wine: whence S. <hi>Cypre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> Ser. <hi>de Coena Domin. The bread which he gave to his Diſciples changed not in</hi> Eſſigies, <hi>or reſemblance; but in nature is made fleſh by the Omnipotency of the word; as in the perſon of Chriſt, the humane nature was ſeen, and the Divinity lay hid, ſo in the viſible ſacrament the divine eſſence diffuſed it ſelf:</hi> Give me leave, (good Reader) to ſet down the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58254:49"/>words of <hi>Theophilact</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bulga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and no mean interpreter of the ſacred Text: who in <hi>Mark. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>This is my body, this I ſay, which ye take, for the bread is not a figure or example of Chriſts body, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſame body of Chriſt, for our Lord ſaid, The bread which I will give, is my fleſh; he ſaid not, is the ſign of my fleſh, but is my fleſh;</hi> And again, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man. And doeſt thou ſay, fleſh is not ſeen: O man! that is done for our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, becauſe Bread and wine, are of thoſe things, with which we are accuſtomed, we do not abhor them, but we ſhould not bear, but abhor, ſeeing fleſh and bloud, ſet before us:</hi> Wherefore our <hi>merciful God condeſcending to our infirmities, conſerves the</hi> ſpecies <hi>and forms of bread and wine, but tranſelementates them into the vertue of fleſh and bloud,</hi> from whence I conclude, that as it is poſſible to God to conſerve the accident or <hi>ſpecies</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſtantial ſubject, for to him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible, to the conſtant belief of the holy Catholick Church, in all times has been, that thoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> are conſerved, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily following that great Myſtery.</p>
               <p>The 3. Miracle to be baited at by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; is, that the body of Chriſt ſhould be contained in ſo little a place, or room as the Hoſt, nay, in every parcel or part thereof. Although this be miraculous, yet it follows
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58254:50"/>from the very being of our Saviour in the Euchariſt; for Chriſts body is not there, with his natural dimenſion or Circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place, for ſo we could not eat him, nor receive him in our Mouths; nor the bread cover him; unleſs we ſhould ſay, that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. a <hi>Camel might paſs though the eye of a needle,</hi> which nevertheleſs is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to what our Saviour there ſayes, <hi>with men, this is impoſſible, but with God al things are poſſible,</hi> beſides God is not tyed to natures laws, as may be ſeen 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. Iron did forget its natural weight, and ſwom on the water. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. water loſt its fluxibility, and ſtood up as a wall; In like manner the flowing of <hi>Jordan, Joſue</hi> 3. did ſtand and become like a mountain, 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. the pot of meal failed not, and the veſſel of Oyl diminiſhed not, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. the fire loſt its natural activity, <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. the Sun loſt its light.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58254:50"/>his diſciples, the doors being ſhut. All theſe things are above the law of nature; and ſhall we deny the poſſibility of ſuch like, to the God of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come nearer to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Chriſts body is now glorious, and is in the Euchariſt in a ſacramental and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, not different from the being of a ſoul: which is as well in every part and parcel of the body, as in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and ſhall we deny that to Gods power, which he wrought in our ſouls, which are indiviſibly, and without any commenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place; This is confirmed by S. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Haeres,</hi> 64. <hi>Even as our Lord did riſe from the dead, not taking another body; but the ſame that was, and no other from that which was; but changing that which was into a ſpiritual ſubtillity, and making the whole ſpiritual: he entred in by the doors ſhut, that which could not be done here in our bodies, for groſſneſs, and for that as yet they are not joyned in a ſpiritual ſubtillity.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame miracle of entring the doors being ſhut, on that place gives the reaſon, for <hi>ſith he is true God, he is not ſubject to the law of nature.</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in c. 24. luc. <hi>Not by corporeal nature, but by a quality of a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real reſurrection; that it was not by natures law but by a ſubtillity of a glorified body which has no commenſuration of place: but is as the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58254:51"/>Angells in great or little place.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that the body of our Saviour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Nature, and for our benefit and commodity, ſhould be as well in the whole hoſt as in every part thereof.</p>
               <p>But ſome will cavill, on what is ſaid, that Chriſts Body is indiviſibly, as the ſoul is in the whole Body, and in every part thereof, how little ſoever; but we ſee by experience, that if any part be ſeparated from the whole, the ſoul remains no more in it; admitting therefore that the Body of Chriſt, is in the whole Hoſt, yet if any part be ſeparated from the whole, Chriſts body alſo ſhall not be in that part ſo ſeparated.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, there is no proportion between the works of nature, ſo conſtituted by God, and the works of God, in his omnipotent power: whence to argue againſt Gods works by the ordinary courſe of Nature, is to limitate Gods power, to what he has actually done; whereas no act <hi>ad extra,</hi> can be equal to his power, no effect can fully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to his power. God made the world, and yet can make millions of worlds: God ordained ſuch and ſuch effects in nature, and can as well ordain many other, yea, different and contrary, or exceeding in the ſame kinde. It is meer folly to think that God can do nothing but what we can conceive or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and; as if the infinite wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58254:51"/>of God did not exceed our finite, weak, and in compariſon, no faculty at all, Gods power is immenſe and without Limit. <hi>Ipſe dixit &amp; fact a ſunt:</hi> whatſoever he ſayes is done, and can do more things then any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can conceive or Imagine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no compariſon in theſe two ſubjects, for the part ſo ſeparated from the whole, is now no more capable to retain the vital form, either vegetive or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and conſequently according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures law, is uncapable of any rational form; to wit, the ſoul which gives no longer life to it, being limited by the Authour of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In our Caſe there is ſtill the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and capacity in every part as in the whole, and conſequently there ariſes no mutation, but only a numerical difference, which nothing alters the nature of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which joynt or ſeparate, retain the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of bread or wine, which are ſenſible ſigns required in this Sacrament; as long therefore as this ſenſible ſigne or <hi>ſpecies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, ſo long the thing ſigned or ſignified remains. The body of Chriſt has no union with the Accidents nor any reference to them but in as much as they are ſacramental ſigns of his body and bloud, ſo made by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; in this their is no regard to the greatneſs or littleneſs of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but to the Inſtitution of Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58254:52"/>who made thoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> to be the ſacramental ſignes of his body and bloud whereſoever we find theſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> after due conſecration, either little or great; according to our Faith, we believe the true body and bloud of Chriſt Jeſus to be.</p>
               <p>We may exemplifie this in a looking-Glaſs, where the ſame face is repreſented, in the whole Glaſs, and in every proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable part thereof, becauſe the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of repreſentation is as well in every part, as in the whole: So as is ſaid before, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of bread and wine, either in whole or in part in great or in little, have annexed to them the nature of a ſign, and no other then what Chriſt himſelf has inſtituted, and conſequently do repreſent that whereof they are a ſigne, that is, the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the Doctour makes diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, concerning Chriſts Body being in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, he may know that to be in a place or in many places or in no place, makes no difference of the eſſence or nature of any thing. The higheſt heavens have there eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, although they have no place; and the being in a place is a meer accidental and extrinſecal thing to the ſubſtance, which of it ſelf occupies no place at all; but by quantitative dimenſion, is correſpondent to place, otherwiſe it is indifferent to this or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58254:52"/>that place, to one, and to many; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that limited and determined created things, to ſuch or ſuch a place, can he not alter, or make it illimitated, or indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to place or places? even by nature one thing may have different extenſions to place as is to be ſeen in rarefaction and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: and cannot God make the ſame thing to have extenſion to ſeveral places? of this we have many experiences out of the Scripture: for we read that our Saviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to S. <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 9. <hi>he that appeared to them in the way;</hi> which alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> relates, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. and according to the text <hi>Act.</hi> 26. <hi>Chriſt himſelf ſayes that he appeared to him, Act.</hi> 23. S. <hi>Luke</hi> affirms, that <hi>our Lord was ſtanding by S.</hi> Paul, if we will believe S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>He had ſeen Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> which alſo he affirms; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Chriſt was ſeen of more then five hundred bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren together, he was ſeen of</hi> James, <hi>and then of all the Apoſtles, he was ſeen alſo by me;</hi> ſo that we cannot doubt but Chriſt appeared unto him, and yet according to our Faith, he ſits ſtill at the right hand of the Father in heaven, as it is declared, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. whence it is manifeſt, that he was in two places, and why not in heaven and in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; and why not as well in many places? and why not by participation of a divine being, may the effects of the divine power
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58254:53"/>to be in many places: One voice fills many places, and one ſound fills many parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diviſion of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides this difficulty is leſſe in regard that Chriſts body is not here, in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative Dimenſion or commenſuration to place, but in a myſterial and Sacramental manner, ſtill united to the Divinity; which is in all places with Power, to limitate the body to as many places as it pleaſes: as God may limit his univerſal preſence in ſuch manner, as his preſence may be in ſome particular places or things, by ſhewing his power, more in one place then in another: even as he has done in the Euchariſt making his Body ſubſtantialy preſent in all places of the world; wherein he has manifeſted his Immenſe power and will; according as the holy Catholick Church has always believed and taught from its beginning; as it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declared in the precedent teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the holy Fathers.</p>
               <p>The 4th. Miracle is; that the body of Chriſt being but one, is communicated to many, yea thouſands, yea Millions. This follows the inſtitution of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it was not inſtituted for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but <hi>for many,</hi> without any limitation of time, place, or perſons; it is a Sacrament that is common to all, in all ages, during this life, and therefore if the true body and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58254:53"/>bloud of Chriſt be contained therein; as the holy Church has alwais believed, and that as a Sacrament it is communicable to all; and all are commanded to take and eat, this neceſſarily follows Chriſts Inſtitution; The holy Fathers who lived within five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, believed and taught the very ſame which the preſent Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves; <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus</hi> hom. 5. de Paſch. <hi>The holy receiving of the Euchariſt, conſiſts not in the quantity, but in the vertue, that body which the Prieſt diſtributes is as great in a little hoſt, as in a great, which when the Church of the faithful takes, as it is compleat in all, ſo it is manifeſt to be entire in every one,</hi> for as he ſays, a little after, <hi>when they take of this bread, every one has nothing leſſe then all; one perceives the whole, two have the whole, and many the whole, without any diminution; for the benediction, of this ſacrament may be diſtributed, but not conſumed by diſtribution,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſer. <hi>de verbis Evangelii. Chriſt is eaten, and eaten lives, becauſe being ſlain he roſe again, neither when he is eaten, do we make parts of God, as truly in the Sacrament it is done, as the faithful know, for even as every one who eats Chriſts fleſh, takes his part, for hence it is called parts, he is eaten by parts, and remains entire and whole in heaven; he alſo remaines entire and whole in thy heart.</hi>

               <p>I Am ſo weary with the Doctours vain raillery, that I am willing to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that I reflected on two main grounds of his rallying, and ſcoffing ſpirit: the one is the inſiſting ſo much on humane reaſon and ſenſe; and the great bugbear Tranſubſtantiation. Of the firſt I ſhall treat in the two following Chapters, and after of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it is a general Doctrine in Gods Church, that faith has for its Object God revealing; Its formal object is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, the material only thoſe things which are revealed; ſo that we know
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58254:55"/>nothing by faith, but by revelation, not by reaſon, much leſſe by ſenſe: true it is that humane reaſon and ſenſe concurr to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of faith, but not to the procuring a divine and ſaving faith: nevertheleſs reaſon and ſenſe may engender a humane faith, by hearing or reading things revealed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the certainty of them; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying only on revelation.</p>
               <p>Whence the holy Fathers do commonly teach, that if reaſon or ſenſe do comprehend any thing, it is no more an object of faith. S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> tract. 27. and 40. in <hi>Johanem. Faith is to believe what thou ſeeſt not, whoſe verity and reward, is to ſee that thou doeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> Again, <hi>tract.</hi> 39. <hi>This is the praiſe of faith, if that which is believed be not ſeen, for what great thing is it, if that be believed which is ſeen.</hi> S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> hom. 26. in <hi>Evangelium. Faith has not merit, where humane reaſon gives experience.</hi> Great S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſer. de fid. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. tels us, that <hi>Faith is an aſſenting appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation without any heſitation; without any parſwaſion of the minde, as in the truth of thoſe things, which by Gods gift are preached, and declared in the Church.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. <hi>let faith be thy guide, in the holy words which are from God; and not demonſtration: Faith (I ſay,) inviting thy ſoul, yea, and perſwading above all rational methods; for faith relies not, on grammatical proofs, but inſinnuats it ſelf
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58254:55"/>unto our minds, by the efficacious operation of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> tract. <hi>de advent.</hi> affirms, that <hi>faith conceived of an evident matter, cannot be called Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us hear, what the holy Fathers, in thoſe primitive times, did teach and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning our preſent ſubject, of the Euchariſt: I ſhall begin with S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> lib. 4. in <hi>Joan.</hi> cap. 17 <hi>This thing is hard, and is to be received, rather by faith, then by any other means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> l. 3. de Trin. <hi>We are not to ſpeak of divine things, in a humane or worldly ſence, neither are we to extort or wreſt, by violent and imprudent report, the celeſtial words, to our wit or impious underſtanding; it is perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, let us read what is written; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we read, then we ſhall perform the office of faith: for what we ſay of the natural body of Chriſt in us, we ſpeak fooliſhly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly unleſs we learn of him.</hi>

               <p>From what hath been ſaid, we plainly gather, that in matters of faith, we ſtand not to humane reaſon, much leſſe to our ſenſes; we may adde, No ſenſe or humane reaſon could tell us, that Chriſt, on earth, was God. The wiſe men who came from the Eaſt; according to their ſenſes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yea, or humane underſtanding; could conceive nothing but a little Child; yet inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, in Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they adored the little Childe, not as ſuch, but as being God and man, which no ſenſe or humane reaſon could dictate to them: The Diſciples <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. did not adore Chriſt by the rule of their ſenſes or humane reaſon, but when by faith they believed him to be the Son of God, even after the Reſurrection they did ſee Chriſt, ſome believed, others did not; many who lived, converſed, and were in his company, both ſimple and wiſe, could never be convinced by their ſenſe or reaſon, that he was the Son of God; and thoſe who were of the ſimple ſort, ſooner believed, and were we not aſſured by divine revelation, and teſtimony, we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either this or any other myſtery of our Faith.</p>
               <p>Where even according to reaſon, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58254:57"/>that we have a more ſure ground to believe Gods word, then our ſenſes; who perceive not the ſubſtance of the bread, which is not perceptible by any of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; whoſe objects are only accidents, or ſenſible qualities; which they have as well in the conſecrated hoſt, or unconſecrated, without any reflexion on the ſubſtance: as, being out of the ſphere of their objects: ſo that they diſcern not any thing of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or whether they be without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is only the underſtanding, which gathers by ſuch or ſuch accidents, ſuch or ſuch a ſubſtance or ſubject and by natures ordinary courſe, judgeth it to be bread; but enlightned by faith and believing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible to God; and that God in moſt expreſs terms declared his body and bloud to be in the Euchariſt; the words are ſo clear, that without wreſting the terms, none ſo ſimple but they may underſtand them, as clearly as <hi>Peter</hi> is a man: and thoſe who contradict it on the ground of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are as the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>ſenſual men,</hi> not perceiving thoſe things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, it is fooliſhneſs to them, and they cannot, or rather will not underſtand, for they are ſenſual, meaſuring theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly myſteries, by natural reaſon; humane prudence, and external ſenſes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Faith.</p>

I know ſome object, that of S. <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> cap. 1. where he attributes much to hearing, ſeeing, and touching, matters of faith: but they do not conſider, that the Apoſtles did hear, and ſee many things, which we believe from their teſtimonies; but if we had only what they ſaw by their ſenſes or humane wiſdome, our faith had been vain, and of no importance, for no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing or ſenſible as ſuch, can be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith: what therefore they ſaw, heard, or touched, was not believed as by faith, but by experience: ſee <hi>Scotus</hi> in 3. quaeſt. 23. the Prophets and Apoſtles had a ſcience which was not faith. Faith taught them that the word was incarnate, and that Chriſt who died, roſe again and aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, was the true Son of God; now to us who have not ſeen them they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of faith, as being only revealed unto us, whereof we have teſtimony from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Tradition S. <hi>Thomas</hi> indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, becauſe he had ſeen Chriſt after his reſurrection, <hi>Joan.</hi> 20. but as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, <hi>tract.</hi> 121. in <hi>Joan. He did ſee, and touch man, and confeſſed God whom he did not ſee, nor touch; but by this which he did ſee and touch, that he believed now, all doubt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and therefore he cryed out, My Lord and my God; and Jeſus ſaid unto him, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, by ſight, and touch, and

               </p>
               <p>Moreover S. <hi>John</hi> in this place oppoſes two diverſe hereſies, to wit, thoſe who deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſts divinity, and thoſe who denied his humanity, and therefore begins his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, <hi>That which was from the beginning,</hi> which he had declared in the beginning of his Goſpel, and for the other which <hi>we have heard by a voice from heaven, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, we teſtifie unto you;</hi> weereby he manifeſtly teſtifies that Chriſt in humane nature had true fleſh and bloud, God and man; now becauſe he was inſpired by the holy Ghoſt &amp; one of Chriſts Apoſtles, according to the teſtimony of the Scriptures, we believe what he ſaw and heard, to be true; and receive it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58254:60"/>know, that God did not without reaſon, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mortal men by theſe, paſt his reaſon: we know not his reaſon in many things, yet we know that what he wills, is no way impoſſible, who has told us, to whom we muſt never impute falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor imperfection.</hi> The lattin words are, <hi>Nos non poſſe confiteremur, eo quod iſtis, &amp; ſimilibus Dei miris operibas, infirma mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ratiocinatio vinceretur: fixam apud nos eſse rationem, non ſine ratione Omnipotentem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, unde animus humanus infirmus, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non poſſit reddere: &amp; in mult is quidem rebus incertum nobis eſſe, quid velit; illud ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſſe certiſſimum, nihil corum illi eſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibile, quaecunque voluerit, eique nos credere praedicenti, quem neque impotentem neque men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientem poſſumus credere.

Cannot the power of God exceed them in working ſuch things as are incredible to Infidells or hereticks, but eaſy to his Omnipotency? God being the Author of Nature, why do they ask a ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of us, when in proving what they hold to be impoſſible, we affirm, that it is thus by the will of Almighty God, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Our Adverſaries will not give credence to the Church, affirming, teaching and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in all times the verity of ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with a proud ſuppoſition, as if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty could do nothing that exceeds their capacities to conceive: we know no better or ſtronger Reaſon can be given for any thing, then to ſay, God Almighty can, or will do this; which he hath promiſed in the ſacred Text, wherein he hath declared as ſtrange things as theſe which alſo he has performed: ſurely he will do theſe; becauſe he has ſaid he will, as he hath made the incredulous Heathens to believe things which they held to be impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Let not the faithful hoodwink themſelves in the knowledge of Nature, as though Gods power could not alter the nature of any thing, from what it was before, unto mans knowledge, let them not think theſe things to be contrary to nature; ſince they are effected by the will of God, the Lord and maker of Nature; they are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Nature, but at moſt, againſt the common Order of Nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in regard of other ſuch wonderful things, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed as properly to our preſent ſubject; for Catholicks do confeſs that they cannot
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58254:64"/>give any humane or naturally known reaſon for the Myſteries which follow the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, the moſt that we can ever pretend to, is, to ſhew that there is nothing in them againſt the eſſence of natures being: our whole belief in theſe Myſteries depends on Gods word, wherein he has manifeſted his will which carries with it an omnipotent power, whereto all created things are in obedientiall ſubjection aſwell in their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as accidental being; all mutable, and alterable; according to the will of God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in all accidental qualities or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which alſo he may add to natures being, yea, and alſo give another nature: So he made Iron ſwim, Fire not burn, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to mount, and become paſſible, ſolid things to walk upon it: Humane bodies to aſcend, to be alſo not conſumed by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fire, Things of no weight at all, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells called ſpirits, to deſcend even within the bowels of the earth: God by his will ſo diſpoſing, yea, to be burnt with fire, I might alledg many more examples of this kinde, but theſe may ſuffice; to manifeſt that Gods power is not to be limited to mans humane reaſon, much leſs to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; yea, not to any created Intelligence: what he can do, is known only and ſolely to himſelf; what he has done according to the ordinary courſe of Nature is latent to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58254:64"/>underſtanding, for there are many things whoſe natures and qualities the wiſeſt men are ignorant of: what he has done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary courſe of nature, we know by his revelation, which moves us to believe, not know: we truſt in Gods word, no way doubting of his omnipotency: and therefore we little eſteem, of what the wit of man can think, imagine, or conceive to the contrary. The Church grounded on Gods word and Tradition atteſted by the holy Fathers and Doctors, has always ſo taught us, as partly will be more manifeſt, in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Tranſubſtantiation proved in all the ages of the Church.</head>
               <p>THis terrible word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> is much baited at by this learned Doctor, even as the word <hi>homouſion,</hi> declared and determined by two General Councils, was impugned by the <hi>Arians,</hi> becauſe it was new, and not found in the Scripture; even ſo this word approved by two general Councils, was rayled at by hereticks, when they could not diſprove, what was ſpecified thereby. I will not contend for the word, but for what is ſignified thereby, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58254:65"/>Councils of <hi>Trent</hi> indeed approves the word, <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and explicates it to be: the <hi>Converſion of the whole ſubſtance of the bread and wine into the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> ſo alſo defines it, <hi>can.</hi> 2. In this ſence I ſhall produce Fathers and Doctors of all ages and times ſince Chriſt, and ſo confirm what the Doctor jeeringly, yet moſt ignorantly affirms, when he ſays, that the Maſſe began with <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as indeed it did, for the Maſs was never without it, when the converſion of bread and wine is the eſſential part of the Maſſe, as it has been fully declared.</p>
               <p>I let paſſe his plain contradiction, when forgetful of what he had ſaid before, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Maſſe to have been in the Roman Church for near 1200. years paſt, he now ſays, that it began with <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> which he will have to have been begun, from the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council held in the year 1215. where this matter was declared to be of Faith; not as if it was then newly invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as the common Faith of the Church wherein the whole Chriſtian world agreed; for there were preſent beſides the Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the 3d 412 Biſhops, the two Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Legates of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Primates, and Metropolitans 75.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58254:65"/>of Biſhops, and others without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Embaſſadours of both the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian,</hi> of the King of <hi>France, England, Hungary, Jeruſalem, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Aragon,</hi> and many other Princes, who all conſented to this declaration in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome hereſies of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch was the doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church before that Council, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the oppoſition that was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who for the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was condemned, in three ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils: ſeveral learned men of thoſe times, did write againſt him, as <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franſus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> I. de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. Euchariſt. <hi>The Church ſpread in the whole world, acknowledges bread and wine ſet on the Altar, to be conſecrated, and in the conſecration to be changed incomprehenſibly, and ineffably, into the ſubſtance of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt.</hi> In like manner <hi>Algerus, Guitmans</hi> and <hi>Petrus Cluniacen,</hi> who <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Let them ſee what fooliſh incredulity, what blinde doubting it is, either not to ſee, or doubt, that bread is changed into the fleſh of Chriſt and wine into his bloud, by divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: when by the ſame, many things are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into another, even in the nature of things,</hi> which he proves, by many examples, and concludes, <hi>It is far more (as the holy Fathers of the Church ſay) to create things that have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58254:66"/>no being, than to form other, and other things of thoſe things, which have a being;</hi> all theſe above a 100. years before that Council.</p>
               <p>But nothing more clearly convinces it, then the Recantation, which <hi>Berengarius</hi> made in a Roman ſynod, held, <hi>anno</hi> 1079. above a 130. years before the ſame Council, in this form: <hi>I</hi> Berengarius, <hi>do from my heart, believe, and by mouth profeſſe; the bread and wine placed on the Altar, by the Myſtery of prayers, and words of our Redeemer, to be ſubſtantially converted into the true, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and life-giving fleſh and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; and to be the true Body which was born of the Virgin, which offered for the worlds ſalvation, did hang on the Croſſe, which ſits at the right hand of the Father, and Chriſts true bloud which did flow from his ſide not only by ſigne and vertue of the ſacrament, but in propriety of Nature, and verity of ſubſtance.</hi> In this faith and belief he died.</p>
               <p>A little before this time lived <hi>Theophilact</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bulgary</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> in <hi>Joan.</hi> 6. <hi>Bread by the ſacred words and Myſtical bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, with the comming of the holy Ghoſt, is transformed into our Lords fleſh:</hi> He has the ſame, in <hi>Marc.</hi> 14. adding, <hi>Our merciful God, condeſcending to our infirmity, did keep the</hi> ſpecies <hi>of bread and wine, but tranſ-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated it into the vertue of fleſh and bloud:</hi> And in <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>Mat.

If thou ask, how is this done? it is enough for thee, to hear, that it is done by the holy Ghoſt: even as from the holy Mother of God, our Lord, by the holy Ghoſt did make to himſelf, and in himſelf fleſh:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58254:67"/>there is nothing more manifeſt, or perceptible to us, then that the word of God is truly effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and omnipotent; for the manner of it is ſuch, that it cannot be ſearched or found out by any reaſon: <hi>A little after,</hi> Bread and wine are not figures of Chriſts body (far be it) but the very body of our Lord, joyned to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for ſith our Lord himſelf ſaid, this is not a ſigne of body, but body, nor the ſign of bloud, but bloud: <hi>And again,</hi> If ſome have called the bread and wine, the figure of our Lords body and bloud, they did not ſay it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſecration; but uſurped this word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the oblation was conſecrated: <hi>to be brief, In that place the Saint uſes theſe phraſes,</hi> Chriſt made his body of bread and wine; he made theſe things his body and bloud, the bread and wine are changed into the body and bloud of God: Bread and wine and water are turned into the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>

That God would change the bread and wine of the Sacrament, as he changed water into wine in <hi>Cana. In another place, the ſame Author ſays, that the</hi> Abyſſens <hi>in their Liturgy</hi>

               <p>S. <hi>Clement</hi> lib. <hi>conſtit.</hi> Apoſt. cap. 24. <hi>Look down upon thy ſervant elected, and fill him, with the holy Ghoſt, that he may perform the immaculate, ſacrifice for thy people;</hi> but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58254:73"/>what is more, our Saviour himſelf in his laſt Supper, ordained his Diſciples in the ſame form, <hi>Do this in my remembrance,</hi> whereby our Saviour gave power to his Diſciples to do, that is, to make or offer the ſame ſacrifice as he had done; as I have declared in the firſt chapter, §. 3.</p>
               <p>Our Reformers have mainly endeavoured to take away the true and proper ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and conſequently to take away the Evangelicall Prieſthood, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion, even from the Apoſtles times, yea, from Chriſt himſelf, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continued in the Catholick Church; and to this end the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the nonage of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a new form or ordination, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that none ſhould give any Orders, but in the form preſcribed; which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and again renewed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the 8. yeare of her Reign: To ſpeak only of Prieſthood, which principally makes to our preſent purpoſe, our Catholick Doctors and Controvertiſts did oppoſe againſt their Ordination of Prieſthood; by ſeveral reaſons: and firſt, that they had no lawful Miniſters of their order, that is, no proper and true Biſhops, and conſequently no true ordination, which is clearly proved by <hi>Eraſtus ſenior</hi> in his Scholaſticall Demonſtration, printed in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58254:73"/>year 1662. which I wave and go to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Which is, that the form of Ordination newly invented, is no true form, nor ever uſed in the Church, nor no eſſentiall part, neceſſarily required in the act of giving or miniſtring holy orders: to make this more clear, we may note, that in the Sacrament of Orders, there is required a ſenſible ſign; which Divines call, the materiall part; and the application of this ſenſible ſign, to the ſignification of what is ſigned, which is the formal part. To our purpoſe the Impoſition of hands by the Biſhop, may well be ſaid to be the materiall part of the Sacrament; for of it ſelf it is indifferent to Epiſcopacy, Prieſthood, or Deacon-ſhip; nay, to other ſpiritual effects, as of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> yea, of <hi>remiſſion</hi> and <hi>abſolution,</hi> and is neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and appropriated to this or that effect, by certain words, expreſſing the power and nature of this or that Order: In this all Catholicks do agree, and ſome of your Learned Proteſtants acknowledge: M. <hi>Maſon</hi> one who hath written purpoſely of this Subject, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Impoſitionem manuum ut ſignum ordinis ſenſibile amplecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, forma ſenſibilis ſita eſt in verbis, quae preferuntur dum ſignum ſenſibile exhibetur:</hi> We embrace Impoſition of hands, as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſigne of order: The eſſential form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58254:74"/>in words, which are ſpoken whilſt the ſenſible ſigne is uſed; in which alſo thoſe who reformed the Roman Ordination, did agree, when retaining the impoſition of hands, they invented a new form, never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before in Gods Church, nor yet coming home to the purpoſe; for no words can be ſaid to be the true form of any Sacrament which does not determine the ſenſible ſigne to its proper effect or office: In the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Prieſthood, it muſt ſignifie the grace and power which is given to him that receives the Order of Prieſthood: ſo the foreſaid Mr <hi>Maſon, Iſtius modo verba qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus de notant datam poteſtatem, ſunt illius forma eſſentialis.</hi> The learned Biſhop of <hi>Derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in his book of the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and ſucceſſion of Proteſtant Biſhops;</hi> page 226. comes more home, ſaying; <hi>The form or words, whereby men are made Prieſts; muſt expreſs power to conſecrate or make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Chriſts body and bloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for we have no difference with the Romaniſts, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. They who are ordained prieſts ought to have power to conſecrate the Sacraments of Chriſts body and bloud, that is, to make it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> Doctour <hi>Sparrow</hi> is of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is noted in the ſaid <hi>Liturgicall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> part 1. cap. 26. and Doctour <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi> in his book of <hi>Juſt weights and meaſures,</hi> cap. 21. <hi>All Ordination tends to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58254:74"/>and communion of the Euchariſt, as well that of Biſhops, to the end that they may ordain the other Orders, and that of Deacons that they may wait upon the celebration of it; As that of Prieſts, that receiving the power of the keyes, to warrant the effect of it, they may therefore have power to celebrate it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely the preſent Engliſh Church muſt be of the ſame judgment, when only thoſe who are ordained Prieſts have authority to conſecrate the Euchariſt, which is their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar proper and principall office, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to none other: the Power and authority to them in this cannot be from any humane authority but divine, which comes unto us by the work of the Holy Ghoſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Now in the Form of Ordination invented by order of Parliament in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and uſed ſince in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> time, no ſuch power is expreſſed; for all the words ſavour more of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or execution of what follows the nature of the order of Prieſthood: without which the reſt is of no Force, for without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>ex vi ordinis,</hi> no actions <hi>ex vi officii</hi> are authentical, or valuable: for as Mr <hi>Maſon</hi> well ſays, l. 2. c. 16. <hi>Non verba quaelibet huic inſtituto inſerviunt, ſed quae ad ordinis conferendi poteſtatem exprimendam ſunt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodata; dum per Apoſtolum</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58254:75"/>Chriſtus, ut crearentur Miniſtri; mandavit implicite, ut inter ordinandum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba adhiberentur Idonea quae dati tam ordinis poteſtatem complecterentur: iſtius modi autem verba, quatenus Datam poteſtatem denotant; ſunt illius ordinis forma eſſentialis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be no form expreſſing or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power, the moſt eſſential part is wanting, and conſequently no true Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Doctour <hi>Bramhal</hi> well conſidered this defect in all the following words of their form in Ordination, and therefore he attributes the giving of this power, to the words: <hi>Accipite ſpiritum ſanctum, receive ye the holy Ghoſt.</hi> In which is contained the power to conſecrate; but firſt, theſe words, <hi>receive ye the holy Ghoſt,</hi> are as indeterminate, as the impoſition of hands; And <hi>Act.</hi> 8. in order to Confirmation and no wayes to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>v.</hi> 17. It is ſaid, <hi>they impoſed their hands upon them; and they received the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Secondly the Apoſtles were made prieſts, in the laſt ſupper; without theſe words, and when our Saviour did uſe theſe words he ſpecifies and determines the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which was given thereby, whoſe ſins ye forgive ſhall be forgiven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Doctour <hi>Bramhal</hi> will ſtill inſiſt, that in ſaying, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>Receive the grace of the holy Ghoſt, to exerciſe the office of Prieſthood, to which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58254:75"/>thou haſt been now preſented.</hi> If this had been expreſſed, the difficulty would ſoon ceaſe, but this is a meer invention of this learned Doctour, who tells rather what it ought to be, then what it is; for during well nigh a hundred years the Engliſh Biſhops never made ſuch expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will ſay; the Biſhops al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by thoſe words did intend, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe words: It is very probable that Biſhop of <hi>Bramhal</hi> did ſo underſtand it; but neither the meaning nor Intention of the Ordainer, can add any force or vertue to the ſacrament, or be ſufficient to produce ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental effects, without words determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſpecifying the Ordination, which is, the moſt eſſential part or form of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>No wonder then, that we make difficulty in their Form of Ordination; when in the late <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> The Clergy of the Kingdom, as ſuppoſing the precedent form of Ordination inſufficient, and not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, have determined, that the true form of Ordaining Prieſts is, <hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt in the office of a Prieſt:</hi> which in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the ſame with what the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church uſeth; which is, <hi>The divine grace which always cures the infirm, and ſupplys what is wanting, promote</hi> N. <hi>this venerable Deacon, to be a Prieſt:</hi> whoſe office, even according
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58254:76"/>to the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> Church, is to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; which alſo in the following prayers they expreſly mention. <hi>Symon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonia,</hi> in <hi>Tract.</hi> de <hi>Ordinat.</hi> affirms, that the Prieſts and Deacons are ordained before the Altar, where the Chalice is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: whence in the Latin Church their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is admitted, becauſe although they uſe not the ſame words, yet they have words, which in a general way expreſs the determination of the material, fignifying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the quality and nature and office of the order of Prieſthood, and diſtinction from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders.</p>
               <p>Now admitting this Form, after ſo long time, made choice of, not to condemn it for a not-ſufficient form, or reproving it, but only that it is different from the uſe of the Weſtern Church; which always had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words in their Ordination of Prieſts; from whence thoſe who were under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark of the Weſt, ought not to differ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Decree of the ſecond <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitan</hi> Councel, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. that no ordination ſhould be uſed, but what was approved by the Councel; but omitting this I have two things, to ſay, the firſt, that from the firſt Ordination made in the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 6. there was no true ordination of Prieſthood, untill this late Ordinance in the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> by reaſon that their was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58254:76"/>no eſſential form uſed, and by conſequence there was not true Prieſthood; from whence alſo it follows, there were no true Biſhops: For as Mr <hi>Maſon</hi> well infers, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <hi>Cum Epiſcopum eſſe nequeatqui non fuerit Presbyter, ſi nos presbiteros non eſſe probatum dederint, De Miniſterio Anglico actum eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, that the now Church of <hi>England</hi> doth plainly reject, and renounce the Function or Office of Prieſthood, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they have rejected the very name of Prieſt even in the holy Scripture, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Elder</hi> for <hi>Presbyter,</hi> a name ſignifying antiquity of years, and appropriated as well to ſecular, as Eccleſiaſtical perſons, in their ſeveral callings, never uſed by the Church, in the Dignity of Prieſthood: others retain the name, but not the Office, whence Mr <hi>Maſon</hi> l. 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. ſticks not to ſay, <hi>If by the name of Prieſt, you had meant nothing elſe but a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to whom is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the diſpenſing of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we would profeſs our ſelves Prieſts:</hi> whence they more commonly are called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: Catholicks deny not the name Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in regard of the exerciſe of thoſe functions; for Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons, and other inferiour Orders, may be called Miniſters; ſo S. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 4. calls the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apparitor, which were ſent to viſit the Priſons, Miniſters: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf and <hi>Apollo</hi> Miniſters, that is, inſtruments of Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſayes, <hi>ſo let a man eſteem us, as the Miniſters of Chriſt and the Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of God;</hi> that is, in the exerciſe or uſe of our function or office, which we have received by our vocation or ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereby we receive power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to exerciſe our Miniſtery, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in which principally conſiſts the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon of Ordination; by which, as the ſame Apoſtle ſays, they are made meer Miniſters of the New Teſtament; ſo that all Prieſts are Miniſters, but all Miniſters are not Prieſts: and the word <hi>Prieſt,</hi> plainly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, him that hath power to miniſtrate, and may be called Miniſter in the time of his Miniſtration: The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> cap. 32. v. 21. calls Gods Prieſts and Levites, his Miniſters, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> his brother and coadjutor, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldier, and the Apoſtle and Miniſter of his neceſſities.</p>

               <p>Doctour <hi>Sparrow,</hi> worthily bearing the title of Biſhop of <hi>Exeter:</hi> in his <hi>Rationale,</hi> pag. 309. admits this ſaying; <hi>According to the uſuall acception of the word Prieſt, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies him that offers up a Sacrifice; and proves it, becauſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel have a ſacrifice to offer,</hi> viz <hi>the unbloudy ſacrifice, as it was anciently called, the Commemorative ſacrifice of the Death of Chriſt: which does as really and truely ſhew forth the death of Chriſt, as thoſe ſacrifices under the law did foreſhew it, and in reſpect of the ſacrifice of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, the Ancients have uſually called thoſe that, did offer it up, Prieſts: who</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>afterward, are to offer that holy Bread and Wine, the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this by the Propheſies of Eſay, <hi>cap.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>I will take of them to be Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, ſaith our Lord, that is, of the Gentills;</hi> and <hi>Jeremie,</hi> cap. 33. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>And of Prieſts and Levites there ſhall not fail from before my face a man to offer Holocauſts,</hi> where, ſayes the Doctour, they propheſy of the times of the Goſpel, as will appear by the context and ancient expoſition, to wit, of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters on thoſe places.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid it is manifeſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58254:79"/>from the Texts of the whole Fathers above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged, that the proper office of a Prieſt, is to offer ſacrifice; the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> hath put in the name Prieſt in their form of Ordination, and conſequently muſt admit a ſacrifice which he is to offer, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould take the word Prieſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally, not properly in its right ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſenſe of the Catholick Church: and conſequently it follows; that they have no true Prie thood amongſt them: for it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that neither he that ordains, nor he that is ordained, do intend to conſecrate, or to be conſecrated a ſacrificing Prieſt: for their Intentions are directly contrary: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Mr <hi>Maſon,</hi> as is ſaid before, tels us, that ſuch prieſts as return from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the Engliſh Church ought to depoſe and repudiate the power of ſacrificing; whereas the Councel of <hi>Trent Seſs.</hi> 23. Can. 1. puts an <hi>Anathema</hi> on any one who ſhould ſay, <hi>that in the new Teſtament there is no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or extern Prieſthood, or not ſome power of conſecrating and offering the true Body and bloud of our Lord, and of remitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſins, but only an office and bare Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel, or thoſe who do not preach not to be Prieſts at all:</hi> And <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. of the ſame ſeſſion, <hi>ſacrifice and Prieſthood are ſo conjoyned by Gods ordination, that both have been in every law: when therefore the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58254:79"/>Church hath received from the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the new Teſtament, the holy viſible ſacrifice of the Euchariſt, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be in it a new viſible and extern prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, into which the old Prieſthood is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which the ſacred letter doth alſo ſhew, and the Tradition of the Catholick Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taught, this to have been inſtituted by the ſame Lord our Saviour, and to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors in Prieſthood: power given to conſecrate offer and miniſter his Body and bloud, and alſo of remitting and retaining fins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Councel <hi>Seſs.</hi> 7. Can. 11. If any ſhall ſay that in the Miniſters, when they make or confer the Sacraments, Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not required, at leaſt, of doing what the Church does, be he <hi>Anathema.</hi> The Councel of <hi>Florence, Decreto Eugenij,</hi> ſays, Sacraments are performed by three things, to wit, by ſome thing as matter, by words, as form, and by the perſon of a Miniſter conferring the Sacrament, with intention of doing what the Church doth; if any of theſe be wanting, the Sacrament is not perfect: Even natural reaſon teaching this; for as S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> 3. <hi>quaest.</hi> 64. Artic. 8. ad 1. <hi>The Miniſter becauſe he is a living Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to apply himſelf by Intention,</hi> whereby he intends to do, what Chriſt and his Church doth. It is alſo certain, that an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58254:80"/>ill intention vitiates a good work, and a perverſe Intention alters the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions, which alſo is true in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall actions: for example, he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Baptize, If his intention be not to baptize, or, takes the word, <hi>baptize,</hi> only as it ſignifies a lotion, or waſhing from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral filth; does not rightly baptize; nor do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Church doth. In like manner he that ſays the words <hi>abſolvo te a peccatis,</hi> If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to abſolve him: or for ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, temporal debts, <hi>abſolves not:</hi> The Proteſtants who intend not to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Chriſts Body by the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> by the word <hi>Body,</hi> which they believe in another ſenſe, do not conſecrate. Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with the ſame words and matter, If by the word, <hi>Wife,</hi> they both or either of them underſtand, <hi>Concubine,</hi> is no Matrimony.</p>
               <p>When then the Biſhop intends not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain as a ſacrificing prieſt, but intends the the contrary, his act is ineffectual; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Chriſts Church, the power of conſecrating, and offering the true Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and retaining of ſins, is ſo annexed to the order of Prieſthood, that Prieſthood cannot be without it; and therefore he that intends to give Prieſthood without, gives nothing at all,</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Church of <hi>England</hi> has
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58254:80"/>excluded Ordination out of the number of Sacraments, and withall rejected the Papall power; one may queſtion then, what power or authority they have to give Orders, but principally, from whence they have any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or power to give them power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any offices, belonging to Prieſthood: It cannot be ſaid to be from the words which are not Sacramental, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being no Sacrament, have no Inſtitution from Chriſt, for that end. Moreover it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be from the Church, for the Church can give no ſuch authority but by the Sacraments; and the Reformed Miniſters have no authority from the viſible Catholick Church, or Pope, or Metropolitan, which they profeſſedly reject, and diſclaim: for Ordination is a ſpiritual power which tends to ſpiritual effects. Doctor <hi>Heylin Eccleſ. Reſtit.</hi> in his Preface, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> looked upon her ſelf as the ſole ſountain of both Juriſdictions; and the <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. declares, the Kings ſupremacy, to uſe and exerciſe all ſuch Juriſdictions, ſpiritual, and eccleſinſtical; as by any ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical power, or authority, hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been, or may lawfully be uſed, over the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate of this Realm: yet as Doctor <hi>Bramhall</hi> well ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 63. <hi>The power of the Keys was evidently given by Chriſt in Scripture to his Apoſtles, and their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58254:81"/>Succeſſors, not to Soveraign Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of our Proteſtant Divines and learned Doctours did well conſider this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and therefore moſt of them do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that Ordination is a Sacrament, and conſequently they ground their Ordination on the authority of the former Catholick Biſhops, who in a Sacramental power did ordain them; who according to Dr <hi>Brevent</hi> were all Idolaters, and unlawful Miniſters of the Sacraments, except only Baptiſm in extreme neceſſity: ſo that they have no right to any Ordination but by vertue of the Sacrament, which cannot take effect, unleſs it be dnely adminiſtred by lawful power, and in due form.</p>
               <p>From which; I inferr that our Reformers in taking away, and rejecting the ſacrifice of the Maſs: have alſo rejected the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whoſe principal office is to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and conſequently they have no true Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> no Sacrifice, no Prieſt; no Prieſt, no Sacrifice; wherefore call the Miniſters Prieſts or what you will; if they have not the office and power to conſecrate and offer ſacrifice, they are no Prieſts properly taking the word prieſt, or according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and uſe of the Catholick Church in all ages and times; yea, among Heathens and Infidels: whence it follows, that as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58254:81"/>our Reformers have framed a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo they have invented a new prieſthood never heard of before; giving no other power then to preach and diſpenſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; which may be committed or done by Deacons or Lay-men, as all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtories do teſtifie: on this ground and other defects in their Ordination, the preſent Catholick Church makes no ſcriple (notwithſtanding their pretanded Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to ordain or give Orders to thoſe who being converted and reconciled to the ſaid Catholick Church ſhall humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire it.</p>
               <p>I know ſome will ſay, that this cannot be done without Sacriledge, for even in the Doctrine of the Univerſal Church, Re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, as alſo Re-baptizations, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſacrilegious; whence frequently thoſe who were baptized or ordained by heretical prieſts or Biſhops, were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized nor re-ordained: In conſideration hereof, the now Church of <hi>England</hi> does not re-baptize nor re-ordain prieſts, coming to their communion, but permits them to remain in the Order received, and approves of them in all their function and power: as if they had been ordained by Proteſtant Biſhops.</p>
               <p>This Subject would require a longer Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe then my brevity will permit: I will
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58254:82"/>therefore briefly conclude this Chapter, The Catholick Church hath always deteſted both Rebaptization and Reordination but never made difficulty to Baptize or Ordain ſome who falſly pretended to have been Baptized or Ordained, when really they were not: We have a plain Declaration of this in the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> Can. 19. where thoſe who were baptized by the <hi>Paulianiſts</hi> were abſolutely to be Baptized, becauſe they were not Baptized in the right Form of Baptiſm, to wit, by the Invocation of the holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>The Decree of the Apoſtles <hi>Can.</hi> 68. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares; that baptized or ordained by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, were neither Baptized, nor ordained: which as <hi>Caranzen</hi> notes, is to be underſtood of ſuch Hereticks, who did not obſerve the right Form in miniſtring the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The Church whenſoever it was manifeſt, that the Ordainers had not lawful power, or did corrupt or alter the form of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, judged, that what they had done was <hi>Null,</hi> and of no force, and did ſimply and plainly ordain them: But if upon due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination it were found that the heretical Biſhops were formerly ordained by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Biſhops, who obſerved the true form of the ſacrament, thoſe who received orders from them, and were otherwiſe fitting for it, were received, without any new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58254:82"/>only new power was given unto them for the execution of ſuch and ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for as the learned Doctour <hi>Morinus, de ſacris Ordinat:</hi> par. 3. <hi>Eccercit.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. well notes, It may be admitted that ſuch do receive a Character even thoſe who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained againſt the Canons; but ſo that the vertue of the Character is dulled or blunted, not capable, or not fit for action: the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did eſteem Ordination Canonically gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, could never be blotted out; but that its force or vertue by depoſition might be repreſſed or dulled, that it could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any other Ordination: which may be confirmed by the common Doctrine of the Church, which teaches, that a Prieſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Character received, in ſome cauſes, cannot give either lawfully or validly abſolution.</p>
               <p>As for that which is added, concerning the uſe of the now Engliſh Church, whch re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains not prieſts coming to it, all men know, that according to their Opinion, it would be very Sacrilegious; for no true Proteſtant will deny, but that Catholick Ordination is valid, and of Real force, giving all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vertue belonging to a Prieſt; which to deny, would be deſtructive to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Hierarchy, which has no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for its ſucceſſion, then that their Prieſts and Biſhips were ſo ordained: The
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58254:83"/>true ſtate of the Caſe is, the Catholick Church in ſuch caſe Ordains thoſe who were never truly ordained: if the Engliſh Church ſhould attempt to ordain Prieſts, they ſhould ordain thoſe who were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rightly, and fully ordained.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Whether the Sacrifice of the Maſſe be Idolatry.</head>
               <p>THat the Maſſe hath been held and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in all times a divine and holy Sacrifice, is ſufficiently proved, ſo that to queſtion whether it be Idolatry, is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to condemn the whole Chriſtian Church, of which that prudent and gave D. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi> in his book of <hi>Juſt weights and meaſures, chap.</hi> 1. <q>They who profeſſe the only true Chriſt, and therefore the only true God, do neceſſarily profeſſe to deteſt all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which the profeſſion of Chriſtianity ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually rooted out of the world where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it prevailed, and ſo doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill as ſeriouſly profeſſe; and therefore cannot eaſily be convinced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Idolatry: for without expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing this profeſſion, they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly be Idolaters, without renouncing it by ſuch conſequence, as may convince
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58254:83"/>common reaſon, that they contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and renounce all of them that which all of them profeſſe, they cannot be Idolaters by conſequence. And therefore it is not eaſie to make it appear to common reaſon that they are Idolaters, becauſe then it muſt appear to common reaſon, that ſo great a part of Chriſtendom doth by their profeſſion contradict that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves profeſſe.</q> In the margent he ſays, <hi>They that ſeparate from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as Idolaters, are thereby Schiſmaticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi>
                  <q>The reaſon is clear, for the pretence of Idolatry in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, is no ſufficient ground for any one to ſeparate himſelf from it.</q> And that which Dr. <hi>Brevent</hi> attributes to Idolatry in the Maſs, is meerly framed in his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and it is purely a conceit, or blinde igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or malice, that imputes Idolatry to that which all Chriſtians have believed to have been the greateſt honour that humane nature can give to God.</p>
               <p>If Maſſe be a ſacrifice, as is fully proved before, it cannot be called Idolatry; for either the act or object, muſt make it ſo; ſure not the act, which is approved by Gods word; and to give to God all ſupreme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour cannot be reproved, much leſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is only the true God. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaid well, that the act of ſacrifice, is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58254:84"/>given only to the true God, or to an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or to a feigned God. So that according to the ſenſe of the whole world, ſacrifice is only given to God; the ſole object of this ſacrifice, is the only true God, not to any imagined or falſe God; both which were true Idolatry; but the ſacrifice to the true God, cannot be ſaid to be Idolatry, which according to Its Etymologies, is to give <hi>Latria or ſupreme and ſoveraign honour to an Idol,</hi> which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, is <hi>nothing</hi> but only in the eſteem of the Idolater. I think that there is none, who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon, can or dare ſay, that the papiſts in their ſacrifice, do give any honour or worſhip, that is, <hi>Latria,</hi> or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme honour to any falſe Imagined God, for they cannot but know that their conſtant belief is, that there is but one true God, as an abſolute article of their faith: their forms of Liturgies or Maſſes, both in their prayers, rites, ceremonies, and publick belief, are teſtimonies of the ſame; and do plainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the whole ſacrifice is directed and intended only and ſoly to the true God.</p>
               <p>The Maſs, liturgie, or divine ſervice; conſiſting principally in the oblation made to the true God, cannot be ſaid Idolatrous: whence I have often admired, that men of underſtanding, learning, or judgment, ſhould ſo imprudently call it Idolatry; when
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58254:84"/>the Church of <hi>England</hi> in imitation of the Roman Church, has framed a form of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which ſome of them have termed, with the name of <hi>Divine ſervice,</hi> Liturgy, or ſacrifice, and oblation, and has the beſt part of its Prayers, Prefaces, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, that this ſacrifice was not inſtituted by Chriſt, at leaſt, has no ground in the Scripture. I anſwer, firſt, that this may be retorted againſt their form of Communion, which is but of late Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and has no more ground in Scripture. Secondly, admitting this to be true, yet the Maſs cannot be ſaid to be Idolatry, for the Church intends not thereby to give any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to any feigned or imagined God: but only to the true God: the worſt that can be ſaid is, that the Church erred in exerciſing that power that ſhe hath not, or was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in her decrees, but this will never reach to Idolatry. Thirdly, the Church has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed, that Chriſt himſelf inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ſacrifice in his laſt ſupper, as it has been clearly proved before, as alſo that it is grounded in the old and new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Others object, that the Maſs admits of the Adoration of the Hoſt: which is plain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, for ſuch Adoration cannot be ſaid to be exhibited to God, who is not in the Euchariſt; whence M. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his book above-cited, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. makes this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58254:85"/>
                  <hi>They who give the honour proper to God to his creature, are Idolaters: They that worſhip the Hoſt give the honour due to God to his creature, the concluſion follows,</hi> ergo, <hi>they that worſhip the hoſt are Idolaters:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, M. <hi>Thorndike</hi> calls it <hi>a Demonſtration as it ſeemed to others, but not to himſelf:</hi> and therefore ſays, <hi>But will any Papiſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that he honours the Elements of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, or, as he thinks the Accident of them, for God? will common reaſon charge him, to honour that which he believeth not to be there?</hi> A little after, <hi>He that worſhips the Hoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves our Lord Chriſt, to be the only true God hypoſtatically united to our fleſh and bloud, which beiag preſent in the Euchariſt, in ſuch a manner, as it is not preſent every where, there is due occaſion to give it that worſhip in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt which the Godhead in our Manhood, is to be worſhiped upon all occaſions. They who know that the Godhead of Chriſt is the reaſon, for which his fleſh and bloud is worſhiped in the Euchariſt, cannot take that worſhip for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, becauſe his fleſh and bloud is not preſent in the Euchariſt; as they who worſhip it there think it is, for they know that the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt is no Idol to Chriſtians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is worſhipped,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Jewes, Mahometans, Infidells; and Ethnicks, and thoſe who deny the Incarnation, ſhould take Chriſtians for Idolaters in wirſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The ſequel of Adoration to our belief, is no way to be reprehended, and is admitted by moſt of our Reformers, and only thoſe who deny the Real Preſence, can with any reaſon deny it. Thoſe who admit Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation (whereof many were of our firſt pretended Reformers) cannot, nor do any way exclude it; and I ſee not how thoſe who believe the Real preſence in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they pleaſe, can any more; for if Chriſt be there, ſure he is an Object adorable.</p>
               <p>Our preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> plainly admits the Real preſence, as is manifeſted in its Catechiſme before Confirmation; where it is declared, that, <hi>The outward part or ſigne is bread and wine, the inward part is the body and bloud of Chriſt, which are verily and truly taken and received by the faithful in the Lords Supper;</hi> the benefits are the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening

               <p>Nay the peculiar form ordained peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Communion: argues ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al honour to the Euchariſt, and in words can ſignify no leſs, for therein, it is called <hi>the ſacrament of Chriſts body and bloud.

               <p>The Jews and Infidels give ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Chriſtian practiſe of adoring Chriſt Jeſus in the Euchariſt; as is to be ſeen in all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories. <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> acknowledges it in his time; when he ſaid: <hi>I have traveled over the world and have found divers Sects, but none ſo fooliſh as the ſects of Chriſtians; for they devour with their teeth their God whom they adore.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> lib. 22. <hi>contr.

               <p>In the <hi>Liturgical Diſcourſe,</hi> in the place above-cited, this is more fully declared: It might ſuffice, that ſuch has been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practiſe of Gods Church, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

               <p>IN ſuits of Law when men come to a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tryall, before the Kings Judges, the lawyers or Barreſters on both ſides plead their Cauſes, with long and learned ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, delectable to their hearers, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to move the Judges, to be favourable on their ſides. The Judge having with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ear liſtened to their long harangues, riſes up and declares his mind; that the whole difficultie depends on the lawful wittneſſes on either ſide, which being heard, he would according to law give his ſentence.</p>
               <p>Innumerable Authors on both ſides have written on this ſubject, concerning the Maſſe, but as yet little an agreement is made: wherefore omitting long diſcourſes in this ſhort Treatiſe, I ſeek to come to the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58254:90"/>Teſt, and ſtand to the teſtimony of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and approved witneſſes, according to which I am content to have my cauſe ſtand or fall.</p>
               <p>Doctour <hi>Brevent</hi> has produced his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the Maſſe 2.1. many of the learned Schoolmen. 2. many Expoſiters of the Maſſe. 3. the Liturgies or Maſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 4. the Holy Fathers of the primitive times, that is, within five hundred years after Chriſt. 5. the maineſt point wherein he chiefly grounds himſelf is reaſon and Senſe. 6ly. he pretends ſome Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: I have no exception againſt any of theſe witneſſes alledged, only I muſt ſay, that it ſavours of great Ignorance or no leſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, to take any of them as witneſſes againſt the Maſſe: For firſt, there never was ſchoolman yet that wrote againſt it, or ever contradicted it, but ſuch as have fallen from the Church. There books even from the Maſter of the ſentences are extant in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Library<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are all expreſsly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively againſt this Doctour; as every School boy knows. It is ſtrange that he ſhould make any uſe of them for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he knows that all of them were members of the Roman Church; were taught, educated, and did teach, write and expound the Maſſe, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſame Church: moſt of them
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58254:90"/>were Prieſts, or Biſhops or Cardinalls in the ſame, and dayly celebrated the ſacrifice of the Maſſe in the ſame belief and Faith with the Roman Church, which by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this Doctour was in full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Maſſe for almoſt twelve hundred years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man of Judgment would alledge Expoſitors of the Maſſe againſt the whole ſcope and intent of thoſe who have written whole Volumes thereon, for to declare the true ſenſe and meaning of every point, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle and cirenmſtance of the Maſſe; as it is practiſed in the Roman Church, knowing well that if they had taught any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to the ſaid Church; they ſhould be liable to the cenſures thereof, and be noted by all the faithful Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their works were approved and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by their lawfull Superiours, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and ſollowed by all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and followed by all ſchollars in the ſame Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There cannot be greater inſolency, then to produce <hi>Liturgies</hi> againſt <hi>Liturgies,</hi> or <hi>Maſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Maſſes:</hi> for the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy is wholly concerning Liturgie or Maſſe, as they are and have been practiſed by the Chriſtian Church in all times of Chriſtianity; without any variation in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in ſuch manner as the Roman Church
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58254:91"/>how at this preſent uſes. If then in any of thoſe Liturgies, there may be found any thing contrary to the Maſs, it will condemn themſelves, which cannot be imagined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will lay a great blemiſh upon the whole Church, eſpecially the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours thereof; with all the Biſhops, and Paſtors, Councels, and Doctours, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, of groſs Ignorance, in uſing ſuch forms; as ſhould contradict the ſubſtance of what they unanimouſly commended to the faithful.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly It is no leſs ſtrange, that the Doctour ſhould pretend the holy Fathers and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Church, when not only for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twelve hundred yeares, even by his town confeſſion, they all approved the Maſs, but alſo defended it againſt all Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and hereticks; and therefore he rejecte their authorities, and pretends to ſtand to the judgment only of the primitive times, to wit, within five hundred years after Chriſt: In this Treatiſe, I have gone with him to thoſe times; and have produced their teſtimonies from Age to Age, and dare ſay, that in thoſe times he can produce no one holy Father or Doctour, that hath taught any Doctrine in any oppoſition or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any thing of the <hi>Roman Maſed;</hi> where as I have produced moſt of them in oppoſition to whatſoever the Doctour has
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58254:91"/>pretended againſt it: whereunto I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Councils, both general and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, the practiſe of the whole Church, in thoſe times, with the conſent of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Whereas the Doctour pretends, ſome Texts of the holy Scriptures for his cauſe, we may conſider, that he follows therein his own fancy or private ſpirit; without any Expoſitour or Interpreter of thoſe times, imitating the Hereticks of all Ages, who grounded all their errours on the Scriptures, miſconſtrued, and by a counterfeit ſenſe of them, did delude the Ignorant Chriſtians: Of this we have manifeſt experience, in theſe our times, for the innumerable Sectaries now extant do ground themſelves on the Texts of Scripture; which they pretend for their multiplyed ſects. Each one affirming their ſence and meaning of the holy Text, with condemnation of other judgments, and ſo wreſt the Scriptures to their ſeveral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, making their fancies the Rule of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text; whereas Catholicks take the Scripture for the <hi>Rule of their Faith,</hi> follow the judgment and ſence of the one holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as on this preſent ſubject, I have followed the common Doctrine of the holy Church, even in thoſe five hundred years after Chriſt, which the Doctour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:58254:92"/>
Finally, the Doctours maineſt argument is, from humane Reaſon or ſenſe, which I have proved, no way capable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the myſteries of our Faith, which tranſcends above all Reaſon or ſenſe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be no neceſſity of ſuch a ſupernatural gift, without which there is no ſalvation. It is true that reaſon is neceſſary for the reception of Faith, for if we were not reaſonable or rational creatures, we ſhould not be capable to receive Faith; but, that reaſon ſhould guide us in ſupernatural things, is prepoſterous, we know nothing but by our ſenſes which can have no ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or act of ſenſes in ſpiritual or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural objects; ſuch as all Faiths objects are, for the receiving thereof, only the ſenſe of hearing, may concurr, from whence the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding frames intellectual <hi>ſpecies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the things which are revealed and declared unto us by the holy Church, which teaches in all times according to the holy word of God.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of this, S. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 11. defines Faith, <hi>The ſubſtance of things to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the argument of things not appearing to our ſenſes,</hi> or humane reaſon, but of it ſelf is an Blench Demonſtration or convincing Reaſon: for by Faith alone, we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe thoſe things which are revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for faith only ſhews and demonſtrates

It behoves as therefore, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſays, <hi>to bring into captivity all underſtanding</hi> (much more ſenſes) <hi>unto the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> If we be true Chriſtians, by faith we muſt captivate and humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our will, underſtanding, all our reaſon, and all our ſenſes, to the word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Baſil</hi> in <hi>pſal.</hi> 113. ſaid, <hi>All the Articles of our faith are principles grounded only on God revealing, and therefore we need no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition or diſputation by any weak reaſon, but firmly believe them as principles of our Faith, without any examination or Queſtion: it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to all true believers,</hi> that, <hi>Dominus ipſe dixit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objects of our faith are ſupernatural, and the ſubject which we treat of, is, of the Reall and ſubſtantiall Body and Bloud of Chriſt Jeſus being in the Euchariſt, which only the underſtanding by Faith compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. I will therefore ſubmit all I have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58254:93"/>ſaid, to the judgment of all underſtanding perſons, and earneſtly deſire them to ponder what has been pleaded fouthe equitie of my cauſe, which is grounded on the poſitive Texts of holy Scripture atteſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the holy Fathers and Doctours of thoſe primitive times, and ſeconded by the General Practiſe of Gods Church, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in thoſe times, as in all ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without any notable queſtion untill our later times. God out of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy open the Eies of thoſe who go aſtray, and grant them the Light of Faith; ſuch is the continuall prayers of him who earneſtly wiſheth them all health and ſalvation in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
